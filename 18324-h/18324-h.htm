<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The struggle of man against his unseen and silent
enemies, the lower or bacterial forms of life, once one
becomes alive to it, has an irresistible fascination.
More dramatic than any novel, more sombre and
terrifying than a battle fought in the dark, would be
the intimate picture of the battle of our bodies against
the hosts of disease. If we could see with the eye of
the microscope and feel and hear with the delicacy
of chemical and physical interactions between atoms,
the heat and intensity and the savage relentlessness
of that battle would blot out all perception of anything
but itself. Just as there are sounds we cannot
hear, and light we cannot see, so there is a world of
small things, living in us and around us, which sways
our destiny and carries astray the best laid schemes
of our wills and personalities. The gradual development
of an awareness, a realization of the power of
this world of minute things, has been the index of
progress in the bodily well-being of the human race
through the centuries marking the rebirth of medicine
after the sleep of the Dark Ages.</p>

<p>In these days of sanitary measures and successful
public health activity, it is becoming more and more
difficult for us to realize the terrors of the Black
Plagues, the devastation, greater and more frightful
than war, which centuries ago swept over Europe
and Asia time and again, scarcely leaving enough of
the living to bury the dead. Cholera, smallpox,
bubonic plague, with terrifying suddenness fell upon
a world of ignorance, and each in turn humbled
humanity to the dust before its invisible enemies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Even within our own recollection, the germ of influenza,
gaining a foothold inside our defenses, took
the world by storm, and beginning probably at
Hongkong, within the years 1889-90, swept the
entire habitable earth, affecting hundreds of thousands
of human beings, and leaving a long train of
debilitating and even crippling complications.</p>

<p>Here and there through the various silent battles
between human beings and bacteria there stand out
heroic figures, men whose powers of mind and gifts
of insight and observation have made them the
generals in our fight against the armies of disease.
But their gifts would have been wasted had they
lacked the one essential aid without which leadership
is futile. This is the force of enlightened public
opinion, the backing of the every-day man. It is
the co&ouml;peration of every-day men, acting on the
organized knowledge of leaders, which has made
possible the virtual extinction of the ancient scourges
of smallpox, cholera, and bubonic plague.</p>

<p>Just as certain diseases are gradually passing into
history through human effort, and the time is already
in sight when malaria and yellow fever, the
latest objects of attack, will disappear before the
campaign of preventive medicine, so there are diseases,
some of them ancient, others of more recent
recognition, which are gradually being brought into
the light of public understanding. Conspicuous
among them is a group of three, which, in contrast
to the spectacular course of great epidemics, pursue
their work of destruction quietly, slowly undermining,
in their long-drawn course, the very foundations
of human life. Tuberculosis, or consumption,
now the best known of the three, may perhaps be
called the first of these great plagues, not because it
is the oldest or the most wide-spread necessarily,
but because it has been the longest known and most
widely understood by the world at large. Cancer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
still of unknown cause, is the second great modern
plague. The third great plague is syphilis, a disease
which, in these times of public enlightenment, is still
shrouded in obscurity, entrenched behind a barrier
of silence, and armed, by our own ignorance and
false shame, with a thousand times its actual power
to destroy. Against all of these three great plagues
medicine has pitted the choicest personalities, the
highest attainments, and the uttermost resources of
human knowledge. Against all of them it has made
headway. It is one of the ironies, the paradoxes,
of fate that the disease against which the most
tremendous advances have been made, the most
brilliant victories won, is the third great plague,
syphilis&mdash;the disease that still destroys us through
our ignorance or our refusal to know the truth.</p>

<p>We have crippled the power of tuberculosis through
knowledge,&mdash;wide-spread, universal knowledge,&mdash;rather
than through any miraculous discoveries
other than that of the cause and the possibility of
cure. We shall in time obliterate cancer by the
same means. Make a disease a household word, and
its power is gone. We are still far from that day
with syphilis. The third great plague is just dawning
upon us&mdash;a disease which in four centuries has
already cost a whole inferno of human misery and
a heaven of human happiness. When we awake,
we shall in our turn destroy the destroyer&mdash;and the
more swiftly because of the power now in the hands
of medicine to blot out the disease. To the day of
that awakening books like this are dedicated. The
facts here presented are the common property of the
medical profession, and it is impossible to claim
originality for their substance. Almost every sentence
is written under the shadow of some advance
in knowledge which cost a life-time of some man's
labor and self-sacrifice. The story of the conquest
of syphilis is a fabric of great names, great thoughts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
dazzling visions, epochal achievements. It is romance
triumphant, not the tissue of loathsomeness
that common misconception makes it.</p>

<p>The purpose of this book is accordingly to put the
accepted facts in such a form that they will the more
readily become matters of common knowledge.
By an appeal to those who can read the newspapers
intelligently and remember a little of their high-school
physiology, an immense body of interested
citizens can be added to the forces of a modern
campaign against the third great plague. For such
an awakening of public opinion and such a movement
for wider co&ouml;peration, the times are ready.</p>

<h1>The Third Great Plague</h1>

<h2><a name="Chapter_I" id="Chapter_I"></a>Chapter I</h2>

<h3>The History of Syphilis</h3>

<p>Syphilis has a remarkable history,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> about which it
is worth while to say a few words. Many people
think of the disease as at least as old as the Bible, and
as having been one of the conditions included under
the old idea of leprosy. Our growing knowledge of
medical history, however, and the finding of new
records of the disease, have shown this view to be in
all probability a mistake. Syphilis was unknown in
Europe until the return of Columbus and his sailors
from America, and its progress over the civilized
world can be traced step by step, or better, in leaps
and bounds, from that date. It came from the island
of Haiti, in which it was prevalent at the time the
discoverers of America landed there, and the return
of Columbus's infected sailors to Europe was the
signal for a blasting epidemic, which in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries devastated Spain, Italy,
France, and England, and spread into India, Asia,
China, and Japan.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
For a detailed account in English, see Pusey, W. A.: "Syphilis as a
Modern Problem," Amer. Med. Assoc., 1915.</p></div>

<p>It is a well-recognized fact that a disease which
has never appeared among a people before, when it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
does attack them, spreads with terrifying rapidity
and pursues a violent and destructive course on
the new soil which they offer. This was the
course of syphilis in Europe in the years immediately
following the return of Columbus in 1493. Invading
armies, always a fruitful means of spreading
disease, carried syphilis with them everywhere and
left it to rage unchecked among the natives when the
armies themselves went down to destruction or defeat.
Explorers and voyagers carried it with them
into every corner of the earth, so that it is safe to say
that in this year of grace 1917 there probably does
not exist a single race or people upon whom syphilis
has not set its mark. The disease, in four centuries,
coming seemingly out of nowhere, has become inseparably
woven into the problems of civilization,
and is part and parcel of the concerns of every human
being. The helpless fear caused by the violence of
the disease in its earlier days, when the suddenness
of its attack on an unprepared people paralyzed
comprehension, has given place to knowledge such
as we can scarcely duplicate for any of the other
scourges of humanity. The disease has in its turn
become more subtle and deceiving, its course is
seldom marked by the bold and glaring destructiveness,
the melting away of resistance, so familiar in
its early history. The masses of sores, the literal
falling to pieces of skeletons, are replaced by the inconspicuous
but no less real deaths from heart and
brain and other internal diseases, the losses to sight
and hearing, the crippling and death of children, and
all the insidious, quiet deterioration and degeneration
of our fiber which syphilis brings about. From<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
devouring a man alive on the street, syphilis has
taken to knifing him quietly in his bed.</p>

<p>Although syphilis sprang upon the world from
ambush, so to speak, it did the world one great service&mdash;it
aroused Medicine from the sleep of the
Middle Ages. Many of the greatest names in the
history of the art are inseparably associated with
the progress of our knowledge of this disease. As
Pusey points out, it required the force of something
wholly unprecedented to take men away from tradition
and the old stock in trade of ideas and formulas,
and to make them grasp new things. Syphilis was
the new thing of the time in the sixteenth century
and the study which it received went far toward
putting us today in a position to control it. Before
the beginning of the twentieth century almost all
that ordinary observation of the diseased person
could teach us was known of syphilis. It needed
only laboratory study, such as has been given it
during the past fifteen years, to put us where we
could appeal to every intelligent man and woman to
enlist in a brilliantly promising campaign. For a
time syphilis was confused with gonorrhea, and
there could be no better proof of the need for separating
the two in our minds today than to study the
way in which this confusion set back progress in our
knowledge of syphilis. John Hunter, who fathered
the idea of the identity of the two diseases, sacrificed
his life to his idea indirectly. Ricord, a Frenchman,
whose name deserves to be immortal, set Hunter's
error right, and as the father of modern knowledge
of syphilis, prepared us for the revolutionary advances
of the last ten years.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
There is something awe-inspiring in the quiet way
in which one great victory has succeeded another in
the battle against syphilis in the last decade. If we
are out of the current of these things, in the office or
the store, or in the field of industry and business,
announcements from the great laboratories of the
world seldom reach us, and when they do, they have
an impractical sound, an unreality for us. So one
hears, as if in a speaking-tube from a long distance,
the words that Schaudinn and Hoffmann, on April
19, 1905, discovered the germ that causes syphilis, not
realizing that the fact contained in those few brief
words can alter the undercurrent of human history,
and may, within the lives of our children and our
children's children, remake the destiny of man on
the earth. A great spirit lives in the work of men
like Metchnikoff and Roux and Maisonneuve, who
made possible the prophylaxis of syphilis, in that of
Bordet and Wassermann, who devised the remarkable
blood test for the disease, and in that of Ehrlich
and Hata, who built up by a combination of chemical
and biological reasoning, salvarsan, one of the most
powerful weapons in existence against it. Ehrlich
conceived the whole make-up and properties of salvarsan
when most of us find it a hardship to pronounce
its name. Schaudinn saw with the ordinary
lenses of the microscope in the living, moving germ,
what dozens can scarcely see today with the germ
glued to the spot and with all the aid of stains and
dark-field apparatus. After all, it is brain-power
focused to a point that moves events, and to the
immensity of that power the history of our growing
knowledge of syphilis bears the richest testimony.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_II" id="Chapter_II"></a>Chapter II</h2>

<h3>Syphilis as a Social Problem</h3>

<p>The simple device of talking plain, matter-of-fact
English about a thing has a value that we are growing
to appreciate more and more every day. It is
only too easy for an undercurrent of ill to make headway
under cover of a false name, a false silence, or
misleading speech. The fact that syphilis is a disease
spread to a considerable extent by sexual relations
too often forces us into an attitude of veiled
insinuation about it, a mistaken delicacy which easily
becomes prudish and insincere. It is a direct
move in favor of vulgar thinking to misname anything
which involves the intimacies of life, or to do
other than look it squarely in the eye, when necessity
demands, without shuffling or equivocation. On
this principle it is worth while to meet the problem
of a disease like syphilis with an open countenance
and straightforward honesty of expression. It puts
firm ground under our feet to talk about it in the
impersonal way in which we talk about colds and
pneumonia and bunions and rheumatism, as unfortunate,
but not necessarily indecent, facts in human
experience. Nothing in the past has done so much
for the campaign against consumption as the unloosing
of tongues. There is only one way to understand
syphilis, and that is to give it impartial, discriminating
discussion as an issue which concerns the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
general health. To color it up and hang it in a
gallery of horrors, or to befog it with verbal turnings
and twistings, are equally serious mistakes. The
simple facts of syphilis can appeal to intelligent men
and women as worthy of their most serious attention,
without either stunning or disgusting them.
It is in the unpretentious spirit of talking about a
spade as a spade, and not as "an agricultural implement
for the trituration of the soil," that we should
take stock of the situation and of the resources we
can muster to meet it.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Confusion of the Problem of Syphilis with
Other Issues.</span>&mdash;Two points in our approach to the
problem of syphilis are important at the outset.
The first of these is to separate our thought about
syphilis from that of the other two diseases, gonorrhea,
or "clap," and chancroids, or "soft sores,"
which are conventionally linked with it under the
label of "venereal diseases."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The second is to separate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the question of syphilis at least temporarily
from our thought about morals, from the problem of
prostitution, from the question as to whether continence
is possible or desirable, whether a man should
be true to one woman, whether women should be the
victims of a double standard, and all the other complicated
issues which we must in time confront.
Such a picking to pieces of the tangle is simply the
method of scientific thought, and in this case, at
least, has the advantage of making it possible to
begin to do something, rather than saw the air with
vain discussion.</p>

The three so-called venereal diseases are syphilis, gonorrhea, and
chancroid or soft ulcer. Gonorrhea is the commonest of the three,
and is an exceedingly prevalent disease. In man its first symptom
is a discharge of pus from the canal through which the urine passes.
Its later stages may involve the bladder, the testicles, and other important
glands. It may also produce crippling forms of rheumatism, and
affect the heart. Gonorrhea may recur, become latent, and persist for
years, doing slow, insidious damage. It is transmitted largely by sexual
intercourse. Gonorrhea in women is frequently a serious and even
fatal disease. It usually renders women incapable of having children,
and its treatment necessitates often the most serious operations. Gonorrhea
of the eyes, affecting especially newborn children, is one of the
principal causes of blindness. Gonorrhea may be transmitted to little
girls innocently from infected toilet seats, and is all but incurable.
Gonorrhea, wherever it occurs, is an obstinate, treacherous, and resistant
disease, one of the most serious of modern medical problems, and fully
deserves a place as the fourth great plague.
</p>
<p>Chancroid is an infectious ulcer of the genitals, local in character,
not affecting the body as a whole, but sometimes destroying considerable
portions of the parts involved.</p></div>

<p>Let us think of syphilis, then, as a serious but by
no means hopeless constitutional disease. Dismiss
chancroid as a relatively insignificant local affair,
seldom a serious problem under a physician's care.
Separate syphilis from gonorrhea for the reason that
gonorrhea is a problem in itself. Against its train
of misfortune to innocence and guilt alike, we are
as yet not nearly so well equipped to secure results.
Against syphilis, the astonishing progress of our
knowledge in the past ten years has armed us for
triumph. When the fight against tuberculosis was
brought to public attention, we were not half so well
equipped to down the disease as we are today to
down syphilis. For syphilis we now have reliable
and practical methods of prevention, which have
already proved their worth. The most powerful
and efficient of drugs is available for the cure of the
disease in its earlier stages, and early recognition is
made possible by methods whose reliability is among
the remarkable achievements of medicine. It is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
sound opinion of conservative men that if the knowledge
now in the hands of the medical profession could
be put to wide-spread use, syphilis would dwindle in
two generations from the unenviable position of the
third great plague to the insignificance of malaria
and yellow fever on the Isthmus of Panama. The influences
that stand between humanity and this
achievement are the lack of general public enlightenment
on the disease itself, and public confusion
of the problem with other sex issues for which no
such clean-cut, satisfactory solution has been found.
Think of syphilis as the wages of sin, as well-earned
disgrace, as filth, as the badge of immorality, as a
necessary defense against the loathesomeness of
promiscuity, as a fearful warning against prostitution,
and our advantage slips from us. The disease
continues to spread wholesale disaster and degeneration
while we wrangle over issues that were old
when history began and are progressing with desperate
slowness to a solution probably many centuries
distant. Think of syphilis as a medical and a
sanitary problem, and its last line of defense crumbles
before our attack. It can and should be blotted out.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Syphilis, a Problem of Public Health Rather than
of Morals.</span>&mdash;Nothing that can be said about syphilis
need make us forget the importance of moral issues.
The fact which so persistently distorts our point of
view, that it is so largely associated with our sexual
life, is probably a mere incident, biologically speaking,
due in no small part to the almost absurdly
simple circumstance that the germ of the disease
cannot grow in the presence of air, and must therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
find refuge, in most cases, in the cavities and inlets
from the surface of the body. History affords
little support to the lingering belief that if syphilis is
done away with, licentiousness will overrun the world.
Long before syphilis appeared in Europe there was
sexual immorality. In the five centuries in which it
has had free play over the civilized world, the most
optimistic cannot successfully maintain that it has
materially bettered conditions or acted as a check
on loose morals, though its relation to sexual intercourse
has been known. As a morals policeman,
syphilis can be obliterated without material loss to
the cause of sexual self-restraint, and with nothing
but gain to the human race.</p>

<p>It is easier to accept this point of view, that the
stamping out of syphilis will not affect our ability to
grapple with moral problems, and that there is nothing
to be gained by refusing to do what can so easily
be done, when we appreciate the immense amount of
innocent suffering for which the disease is responsible.
It must appeal to many as a bigoted and
narrow virtue, little better than vice itself, which can
derive any consolation in the thought that the sins
of the fathers are being visited upon the children,
as it watches a half-blind, groping child feel its way
along a wall with one hand while it shields its face
from the sunlight with the other. There are better
ways of paying the wages of sin than this. Best of
all, we can attack a sin at its source instead of at
its fulfilment. How much better to have kept the
mother free from syphilis by giving the father the
benefit of our knowledge. The child who reaped his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
sowing gained nothing morally, and lost its physical
heritage. Its mother lost her health and perhaps
her self-respect. Neither one contributes anything
through syphilis to the uplifting of the race. They
are so much dead loss. To teach us to avoid such
losses is the legitimate field of preventive medicine.</p>

<p>On this simplified and practical basis, then, the
remainder of this discussion will proceed. Syphilis
is a preventable disease, usually curable when
handled in time, and its successful management will
depend in large part upon the co&ouml;peration, not only
of those who are victims of it, but of those who are
not. It is much more controllable than tuberculosis,
against which we are waging a war of increasing
effectiveness, and its stamping out will rid humanity
of an even greater curse. To know about syphilis is
in no sense incompatible with clean living or thinking,
and insofar as its removal from the world will
rid us of a revolting scourge, it may even actually
favor the solution of the moral problems which it
now obscures.</p>

<h3>The Nature and Course of Syphilis</h3>

<p>The simplest and most direct definition of syphilis
is that it is a contagious constitutional disease, due
to a germ, running a prolonged course, and at one
time or another in that course is capable of affecting
nearly every part of the body. One of the most important
parts of this rather abstract statement is
that which relates to the germ. To be able to put
one's finger so definitely on the cause of syphilis is an
advantage which cannot be overestimated. More
than in almost any other disease the identification
of syphilis at its very outset depends upon the seeing
of the germ that causes it in the discharge from the
sore or pimple which is the first evidence of syphilis
on the body. On our ability to recognize the disease
as syphilis in the first few days of its course depends
the greatest hope of cure. On the recognition of the
germ in the tissues and fluids of the body has depended
our knowledge of the real extent and ravages
of the disease. With the knowledge that the germ
was related to certain other more familiar forms,
Ehrlich set the trap for it that culminated in salvarsan,
or "606," the powerful drug used in the modern
treatment. By the finding of this same germ in the
nervous system in locomotor ataxia and general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
paralysis of the insane, the last lingering doubt of
their syphilitic character was dispelled. Every day
and hour the man who deals with syphilis in accordance
with the best modern practice brings to
bear knowledge that arises from our knowledge of the
germ cause of syphilis. No single fact except perhaps
the knowledge that certain animals (monkeys
and rabbits especially) could be infected with it
has been of such immense practical utility in developing
our power to deal with it.</p>

<p>The germ of syphilis,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> discovered by Schaudinn and
Hoffmann in 1905, is an extremely minute spiral or
corkscrew-shaped filament, visible under only the
highest powers of the microscope, which increase the
area of the object looked at hundreds of thousands of
times, and sometimes more than a million of times.
Even under such intense magnifications, it can be
seen only with great difficulty, since it is colorless in
life, and it is hard to color or stain it with dyes. Its
spiral form and faint staining have led to its being
called the <i>Spiroch&aelig;ta pallida</i>.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It is best seen by
the use of a special device, called a dark-field illuminator,
which shows the germ, like a floating particle
in a sunbeam, as a brilliant white spiral against
a black background, floating and moving in the
secretions taken from the sore in which it is found.
Some means of showing the germ should be in the
hands of every physician, hospital, or dispensary
which makes a claim to recognize and treat syphilis.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Syphilis a Concealed Disease.</span>&mdash;Syphilis is not a
grossly conspicuous figure in our every-day life, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
leprosy was in the life of the Middle Ages, for example.
To the casually minded, therefore, it is not
at all unreasonable to ask why there should be so
much agitation about it when so little of it is in evidence.
It takes a good deal out of the graphic quality
of the thing to say that most syphilis is concealed,
that most syphilitics, during a long period of their
disease, are socially presentable. Of course, when we
hear that they may serve lunch to us, collect our carfare,
manicure our nails, dance with us most enchantingly,
or eat at our tables, it seems a little more real,
but still a little too much to believe. Conviction
seems to require that we see the damaged goods,
the scars, the sores, the eaten bones, the hobbling
cripples, the maimed, the halt, and the blind. There
is no accurate estimate of its prevalence based on a
census, because, as will appear later, even an actual
impulse to self-betrayal would not disclose 30 to 40
per cent of the victims of the disease. Approximately
this percentage would either have forgotten
the trivial beginnings of it, or with the germs of it
still in their brains or the walls of their arteries or
other out-of-the-way corners of their bodies, would
think themselves free of the disease&mdash;long since
"cured" and out of danger.</p>

<p><span class="caption">How Much Syphilis is There?</span>&mdash;Our entire lack of a
tangible idea of how much syphilis there really is
among us is, of course, due to the absence of any form
of registration or reporting of the disease to authorities
such as health officers, whose duty it is to collect
such statistics, and forms the principal argument in
favor of dealing with syphilis legally as a contagious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
disease. Such conceptions of its prevalence as we
have are based on individual opinions and data collected
by men of large experience.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Earlier Estimates of the Prevalence of Syphilis.</span>&mdash;It
is generally conceded that there is more syphilis
among men than women, although it should not be
forgotten that low figures in women may be due to
some extent to the milder and less outspoken course
of the disease in them. Five times more syphilis in
men than women conservatively summarizes our
present conceptions. The importance of distinguishing
between syphilis among the sick and among the
well is often overlooked. For example, Landouzy,
in the La&euml;nnec clinic in Paris, estimated recently
that in the patients of this clinic, which deals with
general medicine, 15 to 18 per cent of the women and
21 to 28 per cent of the men had syphilis. It is fair
to presume, then, that such a percentage would be
rather high for the general run of every-day people.
This accords with the estimates, based on large experience,
of such men as Lenoir and Fournier, that
13 to 15 per cent of all adult males in Paris have
syphilis. Erb estimated 12 per cent for Berlin, and
other estimates give 12 per cent for London. Collie's
survey of British working men gives 9.2 per cent in
those who, in spite of having passed a general health
examination, showed the disease by a blood test. A
large body of figures, covering thirty years, and
dating back beyond the time when the most sensitive
tests of the disease came into use, gives about 8 per
cent of more than a million patients in the United
States Public Health and Marine Hospital Service<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
as having syphilis. It should be recalled that this
includes essentially active rather than quiescent
cases, and is therefore probably too low.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Current Estimates of the Prevalence of Syphilis.</span>&mdash;The
constant upward tendency of recent estimates
of the amount of syphilis in the general population,
as a result of the application of tests which will detect
even concealed or quiescent cases, is a matter
for grave thought. The opinion of such an authority
as Blaschko, while apparently extreme, cannot be
too lightly dismissed, when he rates the percentage
of syphilitics in clerks and merchants in Berlin between
the ages of 18 and 28 as 45 per cent. Pinkus
estimated that one man in five in Germany has had
syphilis. Recently published data by Vedder, covering
the condition of recruits drawn to the army
from country and city populations, estimate 20 per
cent syphilitics among young men who apply for
enlistment, and 5 per cent among the type of young
men who enter West Point and our colleges. It can
be pointed out also with justice that the percentage
of syphilis in any class grouped by age increases with
the age, since so few of the cases are cured, and the
number is simply added to up to a certain point as
time elapses. Even the army, which represents in
many ways a filtered group of men, passing a rigorous
examination, and protected by an elaborate system
of preventions which probably keeps the infection
rate below that of the civil population, is conceded
by careful observers (Nichols and others) to
show from 5 to 7 per cent syphilitics. Attention
should be called to the difference between the percentage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of syphilis in a population and the percentage
of venereal disease. The inclusion of gonorrhea
with syphilis increases the percentages enormously,
since it is not infrequently estimated that as high as
70 per cent of adult males have gonorrhea at least
once in a lifetime.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, it is conservative to estimate
that one man in ten has syphilis. Taking men and
women together on the basis of one of the latter
to five of the former, and excluding those under
fifteen years of age from consideration, this country,
with a population of 91,972,266,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> should be able to
muster a very considerable army of 3,842,526, whose
influence can give a little appreciated but very
undesirable degree of hyphenation to our American
public health. In taking stock of ourselves for the
future, and in all movements for national solidarity,
efficiency, and defense, we must reckon this force of
syphilo-Americans among our debits.</p>

<h4 class="smcap">The Primary Stage of Syphilis</h4>

<p><span class="caption">The So-called Stages of Syphilis.</span>&mdash;The division of
the course of syphilis into definite stages is an older
and more arbitrary conception than the one now developing,
and was based on outward signs of the disease
rather than on a real understanding of what
goes on in the body during these periods. The
primary stage was supposed to extend from the appearance
of the first sore or chancre to the time when
an eruption appeared over the whole body. Since
the discovery of the Spiroch&aelig;ta pallida, the germ of
the disease, our knowledge of what the germ does in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the body, where it goes, and what influence it has
upon the infected individual, has rapidly extended.
We now appreciate much more fully than formerly
that at the very beginning of the disease there is a
time when it is almost purely local, confined to the
first sore itself, and perhaps to the glands or kernels in
its immediate neighborhood. Thorough and prompt
treatment with the new and powerful aid of salvarsan
("606") at this stage of the disease can kill all
the germs and prevent the disease from getting a
foothold in the body which only years of treatment
subsequently can break. This is the critical moment
of syphilis for the individual and for society, and its
importance and the value of treatment at this time
cannot be too widely understood.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Peculiarities of the Germ.</span>&mdash;Many interesting facts
about the Spiroch&aelig;ta pallida explain peculiarities
in the disease of which it is the cause. Many germs
can be grown artificially, some in the presence of
air, others only when air is removed. The germ of
syphilis belongs in the latter class. The germ that
causes tuberculosis, a rod-like organism or bacillus,
can stand drying without losing its power to produce
the disease, and has a very appreciable ability to resist
antiseptic agents. If the germ of syphilis were
equally hard to kill, syphilis would be an almost
universal disease. Fortunately it dies at once on
drying, and is easily destroyed by the weaker antiseptics
provided it has not gained a foothold on favorable
ground. Its inability to live long in the
presence of air confines the source of infection largely
to those parts of the body which are moist and protected,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
and especially to secretions and discharges
which contain it. Its contagiousness is, therefore,
more readily controlled than that of tuberculosis.
It is impossible for a syphilitic to leave a room or a
house infected for the next occupants, and it is not
necessary to do more than disinfect objects that come
in contact with open lesions or their secretions, to
prevent its spread by indirect means. Such details
will be considered more fully under the transmission
and hygiene of the disease.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Mode of Entry of the Germ.</span>&mdash;The germ of the disease
probably gains entrance to the body through a
break or abrasion in the skin or the moist red mucous
surfaces of the body, such as those which line the
mouth and the genital tract. The break in the surface
need not be visible as a chafe or scratch, but
may be microscopic in size, so that the first sore
seems to develop on what is, to all appearances,
healthy surface. It should not be forgotten that
this surface need not be confined to the genital organs,
since syphilis may and often does begin at any
part of the body where the germ finds favorable conditions
for growth.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Incubation or Quiescent Period.</span>&mdash;Almost all germ
diseases have what is called a period of incubation,
in which the germ, after it has gained entrance to the
body, multiplies with varying rapidity until the conditions
are such that the body begins to show signs
of the injury which their presence is causing. The
germ of syphilis is no exception to this rule. Its
entry into the body is followed by a period in which
there is no external sign of its presence to warn the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
infected person of what is coming. This period of
quiescence between the moment of infection with
syphilis and the appearance of the first signs of the
disease in the form of the chancre may vary from a
week to six weeks or even two months or more, with
an average of about two or three weeks.</p>

<p>In the length of the incubation period and the
comparatively trifling character of the early signs,
the germ of syphilis betrays one of its most dangerous
characteristics. The germ of pneumonia, for
example, may be present on the surface of the body,
in the mouth or elsewhere, for a long time, but the
moment it gets a real foothold, there is an immediate
and severe reaction, the body puts up a fight, and in
ten days or so has either lost or won. The germ of
syphilis, on the other hand, secures its place in the
body without exciting very strenuous or wide-spread
opposition. The body does not come to its own defense
so well as with a more active enemy. The fitness
of the germ of syphilis for long-continued life
in the body, and the difficulty of marshaling a
sufficient defense against it, is what makes it impossible
to cure the disease by any short and easy
method.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The First Sore or Chancre.</span>&mdash;The primary lesion,
first sore or chancre,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> is the earliest sign of reaction
which the body makes to the presence of the growing
germs of syphilis. This always develops at the point
where the germs entered the body. The incubation
period ends with the appearance of a small hard
knot or lump under the skin, which may remain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
relatively insignificant in some cases and in others
grow to a considerable size. Primary lesions show
the greatest variety in their appearance and degree
of development. If the base of the knot widens and
flattens so that it feels and looks like a button under
the skin, and the top rubs off, leaving an exposed raw
surface, we may have the typical hard chancre,
easily recognized by the experienced physician, and
perhaps even by the layman as well. On the other
hand, no such typical lesion may develop. The
chancre may be small and hidden in some out-of-the-way
fold or cleft, and because it is apt to be painless,
escape recognition entirely. In women the opportunity
for concealment of a primary sore itself is
especially good, since it may occur inside the vagina
or on the neck of the womb. In men it may even
occur inside the canal through which the urine passes
(urethra). The name "sore" is deceptive and often
misleads laymen, since there may be no actual sore&mdash;merely
a pinhead-sized pimple, a hard place, or a
slight chafe. The development of a syphilitic infection
can also be completely concealed by the occurrence
of some other infection in the same place at
the same time, as in the case of a mixed infection
with syphilis and soft ulcers or chancroids. Even a
cold-sore on the mouth or genitals may become the
seat of a syphilitic infection which will be misunderstood
or escape notice.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Pronounced shan'-ker.</p></div>

<p><span class="caption">Syphilis and Gonorrhea may Coexist.</span>&mdash;It is a not
uncommon thing for gonorrhea in men to hide the
development of a chancre at the same time or later.
In fact, it was in an experimental inoculation from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
such a case that the great John Hunter acquired the
syphilis which cost him his life, and which led him to
declare that because he had inoculated himself with
pus from a gonorrhea and developed syphilis, the
two diseases were identical. Just how common such
cases are is not known, but the newer tests for syphilis
are showing increasing numbers of men who never
to their knowledge had anything but gonorrhea, yet
who have syphilis, too.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Serious Misconceptions About the Chancre.</span>&mdash;Misconceptions
about the primary lesion or chancre of
syphilis are numerous and serious, and are not infrequently
the cause for ignoring or misunderstanding
later signs of the disease. A patient who has
gotten a fixed conception of a chancre into his head
will argue insistently that he never had a hard sore,
that his was soft, or painful instead of painless, or
that it was only a pimple or a chafe. All these forms
are easily within the ordinary limits of variation of
the chancre from the typical form described in books,
and an expert has them all in mind as possibilities.
But the layman who has gathered a little hearsay
knowledge will maintain his opinion as if it were the
product of lifelong experience, and will only too often
pay for his folly and presumption accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Importance of Prompt and Expert Medical Advice.</span>&mdash;The
recognition of syphilis in the primary stage does
not follow any rule of thumb, and is as much an affair
for expert judgment as a strictly engineering or legal
problem. In the great majority of cases a correct
decision of the matter can be reached in the primary
stage by careful study and examination, but not by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
any slipshod or guesswork means. To secure the
benefit of modern methods for the early recognition
of syphilis those who expose themselves, or are exposed
knowingly, to the risk of getting the disease by
any of the commoner sources of infection, should
seek expert medical advice at once on the appearance
of anything out of the ordinary, no matter how trivial,
on the parts exposed. The commoner sources of
infection may be taken to be the kissing of strangers,
the careless use of common personal and toilet articles
which come in contact with the mouth especially,&mdash;all
of which are explained later,&mdash;and illicit
sexual relations. While this by no means includes
all the means for the transmission of the disease,
those who do these things are in direct danger, and
should be warned accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Modern Methods of Identifying an Early Syphilitic
Infection.</span>&mdash;The practice of tampering with sores,
chafes, etc., which are open to suspicion, whether
done by the patient himself or by the doctor before
reaching a decision as to the nature of the trouble, is
unwise. An attempt to "burn it out" with caustic
or otherwise, which is the first impulse of the layman
with a half-way knowledge and even of some doctors,
promptly makes impossible a real decision as to
whether or not syphilis is present. Even a salve, a
wash, or a powder may spoil the best efforts to find
out what the matter is. A patient seeking advice
should go to his doctor <i>at once</i>, and absolutely <i>untreated</i>.
Then, again, irritating treatment applied
unwisely to even a harmless sore may make a mere
chafe look like a hard chancre, and result in the patient's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
being treated for months or longer for syphilis.
Nowadays our first effort after studying the
appearance of the suspected lesion is to try to find
the germs, with the dark-field microscope or a stain.
Having found them, the question is largely settled,
although we also take a blood test. If we fail to
find the germs, it is no proof that syphilis is absent,
and we re&euml;xamine and take blood tests at intervals
for some months to come, to be sure that the infection
has not escaped our vigilance, as it sometimes
does if we relax our precautions. In recognizing
syphilis, the wise layman is the one who knows he
does not know. The clever one who is familiar with
everything "they say" about the disease, and has
read about the matter in medical books into the
bargain, is the best sort of target for trouble. Such
men are about as well armed as the man who attacks
a lion with a toothpick. He may stop him with his
eye, but it is a safer bet he will be eaten.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Enlargement of Neighboring Glands.</span>&mdash;Nearly
every one is familiar with the kernels or knots that
can be felt in the neck, often after tonsillitis, or with
eruptions in the scalp. These are lymph-glands,
which are numerous in different parts of the body,
and their duty is, among other things, to help fight
off any infection which tries to get beyond the point
at which it started. The lymph-glands in the neighborhood
of the chancre, on whatever part of the body
it is situated, take an early part in the fight against
syphilis. If, for example, the chancre is on the genitals,
the glands in the groin will be the first ones
affected. If it is on the lip, the neck glands become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
swollen. The affected glands actually contain the
germs which have made their way to them through
lymph channels under the skin. When the glands
begin to swell, the critical period of limitation of the
disease to the starting-point will soon be over and the
last chances for a quick cure will soon be gone. At
any moment they may gain entrance to the blood
stream in large numbers. While the swelling of these
glands occurs in other conditions, there are peculiarities
about their enlargement which the physician
looking for signs of the disease may recognize. Especially
in case of a doubtful lesion about the neck
or face, when a bunch of large swollen glands develops
under the jaw in the course of a few days or a
couple of weeks, the question of syphilis should be
thoroughly investigated.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Vital Significance of Early Recognition.</span>&mdash;The critical
period of localization of an early infection will be
brought up again in subsequent pages. As Pusey
says, it is the "golden opportunity" of syphilis. It
seldom lasts more than two weeks from the first appearance
of the primary sore or chancre, and its
duration is more often only a matter of four or five
days before the disease is in the blood, the blood test
becomes positive, and the prospect of what we call
abortive cure is past. Nothing can justify or make
up for delay in identifying the trouble in this early
period, and the person who does not take the matter
seriously often pays the price of his indifference many
times over.</p>

<h3>The Nature and Course of Syphilis (Continued)</h3>

<h4 class="smcap">The Secondary Stage</h4>

<p><span class="caption">The Spread of the Germs Over the Body.</span>&mdash;The
secondary stage of syphilis, like the primary stage, is
an arbitrary division whose beginning and ending
can scarcely be sharply defined. Broadly speaking,
the secondary stage of syphilis is the one in which
the infection ceases to be confined to the neighborhood
of the chancre and affects the entire body.
The spread of the germs of the disease to the lymph-glands
in the neighborhood of the primary sore is
followed by their invasion of the blood itself. While
this may begin some time before the body shows signs
of it, the serious outburst usually occurs suddenly
in the course of a few days, and fills the circulating
blood with the little corkscrew filaments, sending
showers of them to every corner of the body and involving
every organ and tissue to a greater or less
extent. This explosion marks the beginning of the
active secondary stage of syphilis. The germs are
now everywhere, and the effect on the patient begins
to suggest such infectious diseases as measles, chickenpox,
etc., which are associated with eruptions on
the skin. But there can be no more serious mistake
than to suppose that the eruptions which usually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
break out on the skin at this time represent the whole,
or even a very important part, of the story. They
may be the most conspicuous sign to the patient and
to others, but the changes which are to affect the
future of the syphilitic are going on just at this time,
not in his skin, but in his internal organs, and especially
in his heart and blood-vessels and in his
nervous system.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Constitutional Symptoms.</span>&mdash;It is surprising how
mild a thing secondary syphilis is in many persons.
A considerable proportion experience little or nothing
at this time in the way of disturbances of the
general health to suggest that they have a serious
illness. A fair percentage of them lose 5 or 10
pounds in weight, have severe or mild headaches,
usually worse at night, with pains in the bones and
joints that may suggest rheumatism. Nervous disturbances
of the most varied character may appear.
Painful points on the bones or skull may develop,
and there may be serious disturbances of eye-sight
and hearing. A few are severely ill, lose a great deal
of weight, endure excruciating pains, pass sleepless
nights, and suffer with symptoms suggesting that
their nervous systems have been profoundly affected.
As a general thing, however, the constitutional
symptoms are mild compared with those of the severe
infectious fevers, such as typhoid or malaria.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Secondary Eruption or Rash.</span>&mdash;The eruption
of secondary syphilis is generally the feature which
most alarms the average patient. It is usually
rather abundant, in keeping with the wide-spread
character of the infection, and is especially noticeable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
on the chest and abdomen, the face, palms, and
soles. It is apt to appear in the scalp in the severer
forms. The eruption may consist of almost anything,
from faint pink spots to small lumps and nodules,
pimples and pustules, or large ulcerating or
crusted sores. The eruption is not necessarily conspicuous,
and may be entirely overlooked by the
patient himself, or it may be so disfiguring as to attract
attention.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Common Misconceptions Regarding Syphilitic
Rashes.</span>&mdash;Laymen should be warned against the
temptation to call an eruption syphilitic. The commonest
error is for the ordinary person to mistake a
severe case of acne, the common "pimples" of early
manhood, for syphilis. Psoriasis, another harmless,
non-contagious, and very common skin disease, is
often mistaken for syphilis. Gross injustice and
often much mental distress are inflicted on unfortunates
who have some skin trouble by the readiness
with which persons who know nothing about the
matter insist on thinking that any conspicuous eruption
is syphilis, and telling others about it. Even
with an eye trained to recognize such things on sight,
in the crowds of a large city, one very seldom sees
any skin condition which even suggests syphilis.
It usually requires more than a passing glance at the
whole body to identify the disease. If, under such
circumstances, one becomes concerned for the health
of a friend, he would much better frankly ask what
is the matter, than make him the victim of a layman's
speculations. It is always well to remember
that profuse eruptions of a conspicuous nature,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
which have been present for months or years, are
less likely to be syphilitic.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Contagious Sores in the Mouth, Throat, and
Genitals.</span>&mdash;Accompanying the outbreaks of syphilis
on the skin, in the secondary period, a soreness may
appear in the mouth and throat, and peculiar patches
seen on the tongue and lips, and flat growths be
noticed around the moist surfaces, such as those
of the genitals. These throat, mouth, and genital
eruptions are the most dangerous signs of the disease
from the standpoint of contagiousness. Just
as the chancre swarms with the germs of syphilis,
so every secondary spot, pimple, and lump contains
them in enormous numbers. But so long as the skin
is not broken or rubbed off over them, they are securely
shut in. There is no danger of infection from
the dry, unbroken skin, even over the eruption itself.
But in the mouth and throat and about the genitals,
where the surface is moist and thin, the covering
quickly rubs or dissolves off, leaving the gray or
pinkish patches and the flattened raised growths
from which the germs escape in immense numbers
and in the most active condition. Such patches
may occur under the breasts and in the armpits,
as well as in the places mentioned. The saliva of a
person in this condition may be filled with the germs,
and the person have only to cough in one's face to
make one a target for them.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Distribution of the Germs in the Body.</span>&mdash;The
germs of syphilis have in the past few years been
found in every part of the body and in every lesion
of syphilis. While the secondary stage is at its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
height, they are in the blood in considerable numbers,
so that the blood may at these times be infectious
to a slight degree. They are present, of course, in
large numbers in the secretions from open sores and
under the skin in closed sores. The nervous system,
the walls of the blood-vessels, the internal organs, such
as the liver and spleen, the bones and the bone-marrow,
contain them. They are not, however,
apparently found in the secretions of the sweat
glands, but, on the other hand, they have been shown
to be present in the breast milk of nursing mothers
who have active syphilis. The seminal fluid may
contain the germs, but they have not been shown to
be present either in the egg cells of the female or
in the sperm cells of the male.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Fate of the Germs.</span>&mdash;The fate of all these vast
numbers of syphilitic germs, distributed over the
whole body at the height of the disease, is one of the
most remarkable imaginable. As the acute secondary
stage passes, whether the patient is treated or
not, by far the larger number of the spirochetes in
the body is destroyed by the body's own power of
resistance. This explains the statement, that cannot
be too often repeated, that the outward evidences of
secondary syphilis tend to disappear of themselves,
whether or not the patient is treated. Of the hordes
of germs present in the beginning of the trouble,
only a few persist until the later stages, scattered
about in the parts which were subject to the overwhelming
invasion. Yet because of some change
which the disease brought about in the parts thus
affected, these few germs are able to produce much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
more dangerous changes than the armies which preceded
them. In some way the body has become
sensitive to them, and a handful of them in course of
time are able to do damage which billions could not
earlier in the disease. The man in whom the few
remaining germs are confined largely to the skin is
fortunate. The unfortunates are those who, with
the spirochetes in their artery walls, heart muscle,
brain, and spinal cord, develop the destructive arterial
and nervous changes which lead to the crippling
of life at its root and premature death.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Variations in the Behavior of the Germ of Syphilis.</span>&mdash;Differences
in the behavior of the same germ
in different people are very familiar in medicine and
are of importance in syphilis. As an example, the
germ of pneumonia may be responsible for a trifling
cold in one person, for an attack of grippe in the next,
and may hurry the next person out of the world
within forty-eight hours with pneumonia. Part of
this difference in the behavior of a given germ may
be due to differences among the various strains or
families of germs in the same general group. Another
part is due to the habit which germs have, of
singling out for attack the weakest spot in a person's
body. The germ that causes rheumatism has strains
which produce simply tonsillitis, and others which,
instead of attacking joints, tend to attack the valves
of the heart. Our recent knowledge suggests that
somewhat the same thing is at work in syphilis.
Certain strains of Spiroch&aelig;ta pallida tend to thrive
in the nervous system, others perhaps in the skin.
On the other hand, in certain persons, for example,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
heavy drinkers, the nervous system is most open to
attack, in others the bones may be most affected, in
still others, the skin.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Variations in the Course of Syphilis in Different
Persons.</span>&mdash;So it comes about that in the secondary
stage there may be wide differences in the amount
and the location of the damage done by syphilis.
One patient may have a violent eruption, and very
little else. Another will scarcely show an outward
sign of the disease and yet will be riddled by one
destructive internal change after another. In such
a case the secondary stage of the disease may pass
with half a dozen red spots on the body and no
constitutional symptoms, and the patient go to
pieces a few years later with locomotor ataxia or
general paralysis of the insane. On the other hand,
a patient may have a stormy time in the secondary
period and have abundant reason to realize he has
syphilis, and under only moderate treatment recover
entirely. Still another will have a bad infection
from the start, and run a severe course in spite of
good treatment, to end in an early wreck. The last
type is fortunately not common, but the first type is
entirely too abundant. It cannot be said too forcibly
that in the secondary as in the primary stage,
syphilis may entirely escape the notice of the infected
person, and he may not realize what ails him
until years after it is too late to do anything for him.
Here, as in the primary stage, the lucky person is the
one who shows his condition so plainly that he cannot
overlook it, and who has an opportunity to realize
the seriousness of his disease. It used to be an old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
rule not to treat people who seemed careless and indifferent
until their secondary eruption appeared,
in the hope that this flare-up would bring them to
their senses. The necessity for such a rule shows
plainly how serious a matter a mild early syphilis
may be.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Dangerous Contagious Relapses.</span>&mdash;Secondary
syphilis does not begin like a race, at the drop of a
hat, or end with the breaking of a tape. When the
first outburst has subsided, a series of lesser outbreaks,
often covering a series of years, may follow.
These minor relapses or recurrences are mainly what
make the syphilitic a danger to his fellows. They
are to a large extent preventable by thorough modern
treatment. Few people are so reckless as wholly
to disregard precautions when the severe outburst is
on. But the lesser outbreaks, if they occur on the
skin, attract little or no attention or are entirely
misunderstood by the patient. Only too often they
occur as the flat, grayish patches in the mouth and
genital tract, such as are seen in the secondary stage,
where, because they are out of sight and not painful,
they pass unnoticed. The tonsils, the under side
and edges of the tongue, and the angles of the mouth
just inside the lips are favorite places for these recurrent
mucous patches. They are thus ideally
placed to spread infection, for, as in the secondary
stage, each of these grayish patches swarms with the
germs of syphilis. Similar recurrences about the
genitals often grow, because of the moisture, into
buttons and flat, cauliflower-like warts from which
millions of the germs can be squeezed. Sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
they are mistaken for hemorrhoids or "piles." With
all the opportunities that these sores offer for infection,
it is surprising that the disease is not universal.
Irritation from friction, dirt, and discharges,
and in the mouth the use of tobacco, are the principal
influences acting to encourage these recurrences.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Relapses in the Nervous System and Elsewhere.</span>&mdash;Mucous
patches are, of course, not the only recurrences,
though they are very common. At any time
a little patch of secondary eruption may appear and
disappear in the course of a short time. Recurrences
are not confined to the skin, and those which take
place in the nervous system may result in temporary
or permanent paralysis of important nerves, including
those of the eyes and ears. Again, recurrences
may show themselves in the form of a general running
down of the patient from time to time, with loss
of weight and general symptoms like those of the
active secondary period.</p>

<p>The secondary period as a whole is not in itself
the serious stage of syphilis. Most of the symptoms
are easily controlled by treatment if they are recognized.
Now and then instances of serious damage to
sight, hearing, or important organs elsewhere occur,
but these are relatively few in spite of the enormous
numbers and wide distribution of the germs. Accordingly,
the problems that the secondary stage
offers the physician and society at large must center
around the recognition of mild and obscure cases
and adequate treatment for all cases. The identification
of the former is vital because of the recurrence
of extremely infectious periods throughout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
this stage of the disease, and the latter is essential
because vigorous treatment, carried out for a long
enough time, prevents not only the late complications
which destroy the syphilitic himself, but does
away with the menace to society that arises through
his infecting others, whether in marriage and sexual
contact or in the less intimate relations of life.</p>

<h3>The Nature and Course of Syphilis (Continued)</h3>

<h4 class="smcap">Late Syphilis (Tertiary Stage)</h4>

<p><span class="caption">The Seriousness of Late Syphilis.</span>&mdash;While we
recognize a group of symptoms in syphilis which we
call late or tertiary, there is no definite or sharp
boundary of time separating secondary from tertiary
periods. The man who calculates that he will have
had his fling in the ten or twenty years before tertiary
troubles appear may be astonished to find that
he can develop tertiary complications in his brain
almost before he is well rid of his chancre. "Late
accidents," as we call them, are the serious complications
of syphilis. They are, as has been said, brought
about by relatively few germs, the left-overs from the
flooding of the body during the secondary period.
There is still a good deal of uncertainty as to just
what the distribution of the germs which takes place
in the secondary period foreshadows in the way of
prospects for trouble when we come to the tertiary
period. It may well be that the man who had many
germs in his skin and a blazing eruption when he was
in the second stage, may have all his trouble in the
skin when he comes to the late stage. It is the verdict
of experience, however, that people who have
never noticed their secondary eruption because it
was so mild are more likely to be affected in the nervous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
system later on. But this may be merely because
the condition, being unrecognized, escapes
treatment. It is at least safe to say that those whose
skins are the most affected early in the disease are the
fortunate ones, because their recognition and treatment
in the secondary stage help them to escape
locomotor ataxia and softening of the brain. Conversely
the victim who judges the extent and severity
of his syphilis by the presence or absence of a
"breaking out" is just the one to think himself well
for ten or twenty years because his skin is clean, and
then to wake up some fine morning to find that he
cannot keep his feet because his concealed syphilis is
beginning to affect his nervous system.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Nature of the Tissue Change in Late Syphilis&mdash;Gummatous
Infiltration.</span>&mdash;The essential happening
in late syphilis is that body tissue in which the
germs are present is replaced by an abnormal tissue,
not unlike a tumor growth. The process is usually
painless. This material is shoddy, so to speak, and
goes to pieces soon after it grows. The shoddy tissue
is called "gummatous infiltration," and the tumor,
if one is formed, is called a "gumma." The syphilitic
process at the edge of the gumma shuts off the
blood supply and the tissue dies, as a finger would if
a tight band were wound around it, cutting off the
blood supply. Gumma can develop almost anywhere,
and where it does, there is a loss of tissue that
can be replaced only by a scar. In this way gummas
can eat holes in bone, or leave ulcerating sores in the
skin where the gumma formed and died, or take the
roof out of a mouth, or weaken the wall of a blood-vessel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
so that it bulges and bursts. The sunken
noses and roofless mouths are usually syphilitic&mdash;yet
if they are recognized in time and put under
treatment, all these horrible things yield as by magic.
There are few greater satisfactions open to the physician
than to see a tertiary sore which has refused to
heal for months or years disappear under the influence
of mercury and iodids within a few weeks.
Still better, if treatment had been begun early in the
disease, and efficiently and completely carried out,
none of these conditions need ever have been.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Destructive Effects of Late Syphilis.</span>&mdash;Late syphilis
is, therefore, destructive, and the harm that it
does cannot, except within narrow limits, be repaired.
It is responsible for the kind of damaged
goods which gives the disease its reality for the
every-day person. It is a matter of desperate importance
where the damage is done. Late syphilis
in the skin and bones, while horrible enough to
look at, and disfiguring for life, is not the most serious
syphilis, because we can put up with considerable
loss of tissue and scarring in these quarters and still
keep on living. But when late syphilis gets at the
base of the aorta, the great vessel by which the blood
leaves the heart, and damages the valves there, the
numbering of the syphilitic's days begins. Few can
afford to replace much brain substance by tertiary
growths and expect to maintain their front against
the world. Few are so young that they can meet the
handicap that old age and hardening of the arteries,
brought on prematurely by late syphilis, put upon
them. When late syphilis affects the vital structures
and gains headway, the victim goes to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
wall. This is the really dangerous syphilis&mdash;the
kind of syphilis that shortens and cripples life.</p>

<p>There are few good estimates of the extent of late
accidents, as we often call the serious later complications
in syphilis, or of the part that they play in
medicine as a whole. Too many of them are inconspicuous,
or confused with other internal troubles
that result from them. Deaths from syphilis are all
the time being hidden under the general terms
"Bright's disease," or "heart disease," or "paralysis,"
or "apoplexy." It is a hopeful fact that, even
under unfavorable conditions, only a comparatively
small percentage, from 10 to 20 per cent, seem to
develop obvious late accidents. On the other hand,
it must not be forgotten that the obscure costs of
syphilis are becoming more apparent all the time,
and the influence of the disease in shortening the
life of our arteries and of other vital structures is
more and more evident. There is still good reason
for avoiding the effects of syphilis by every means at
our disposal&mdash;by avoiding syphilis itself in the first
place, and by early recognition of the disease and
efficient treatment, in the second.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Late Syphilis of the Nervous System&mdash;Locomotor
Ataxia.</span>&mdash;The ways in which late syphilis can attack
the nervous system form the real terrors of the disease
to most people. Locomotor ataxia and general
paralysis of the insane (or softening of the brain) are
the best known to the laity, <i>though only two of
many ways in which syphilis can attack the nervous
system</i>. Though their relation to the disease was
long suspected, the final touch of proof came only as
recently as 1913, when Noguchi and Moore, of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Rockefeller Institute, found the germs of the disease
in the spinal cords of patients who had died of locomotor
ataxia, and in the brains of those who had died
of paresis. The way in which the damage is done
can scarcely be explained in ordinary terms, but, as
in all late syphilis, a certain amount of the damage
once done is beyond repair. Locomotor ataxia begins
to affect the lower part of the spinal cord first,
so that the earliest symptoms often come from the
legs and from the bladder and rectum, whose nerves
are injured. Other parts higher up may be affected,
and changes resulting in total blindness and deafness
not infrequently occur. Through the nervous system,
various organs, especially the stomach, may be
seriously affected, and excruciating attacks of pain
with unmanageable attacks of vomiting (gastric
crises) are apt to follow. This does not, of course,
mean that all pain in the stomach with vomiting
means locomotor ataxia. All sorts of obscure symptoms
may develop in this disease, but the signs in the
eyes and elsewhere are such that a decision as to
what is the matter can usually be made without considering
how the patient feels, and by evidence which
is beyond his control.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Late Syphilis of the Nervous System&mdash;General
Paralysis.</span>&mdash;General paralysis, or paresis, is a progressive
mental degeneration, with relapses and
periods of improvement which reduce the patient
by successive stages to a jibbering idiocy ending
invariably in death. Such patients may, in the
course of their decline, have delusions which lead
them to acts of violence. The only place for a paretic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
is in an asylum, since the changes in judgment, will-power,
and moral control which occur early in the
disease are such that, before the patient gets unmanageable,
he may have pretty effectually wrecked
his business and the happiness of his family and
associates. When the condition is recognized, the
family must at least be forewarned, so that they can
take action when it seems necessary. Both locomotor
ataxia and paresis may develop in the same person,
producing a combined form known as taboparesis.</p>

<p>The importance of locomotor ataxia and paresis
in persons who carry heavy responsibilities is very
great. In railroad men, for example, the harm that
can be done in the early stages of paresis is as great
as or even greater than the harm that an epileptic
can do. A surgeon with beginning taboparesis may
commit the gravest errors of judgment before his
condition is discovered. Men of high ability, on
whom great responsibilities are placed, may bring
down with them, in their collapse, great industrial
and financial structures dependent on the integrity
of their judgment. The extent of such damage to
the welfare of society by syphilis is unknown, though
here and there some investigation scratches the surface
of it. It will remain for the future to show us
more clearly the cost of syphilis in this direction.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Syphilis and Mental Disease.</span>&mdash;Williams,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> before
the American Public Health Association, has recently
carefully summarized the r&ocirc;le of syphilis in the production
of insanity, and the cost of the disease to the
State from the standpoint of mental disease alone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
He estimates that 10 per cent of the patients who
enter the Massachusetts State hospitals for the insane
are suffering from syphilitic insanity. Fifteen
per cent of those at the Boston Psychopathic Hospital
have syphilis. In New York State hospitals,
12.7 per cent of those admitted have syphilitic mental
diseases. In Ohio, 12 per cent were admitted to
hospitals for the same reason. An economic study
undertaken by Williams of 100 men who died at the
Boston State Hospital of syphilitic mental disease,
the cases being taken at random, showed that the
shortening of life in the individual cases ranged from
eight to thirty-eight years, and the total life loss was
2259 years. Of ten of these men the earning capacity
was definitely known, and through their premature
death there was an estimated financial loss
of $212,248. It cost the State of Massachusetts
$39,312 to care for the 100 men until their death.
Seventy-eight were married and left dependent wives
at the time of their commission to the hospital. In
addition to the 100 men who became public charges,
109 children were thrown upon society without the
protection of a wage-earner. Williams estimates,
on the basis of published admission figures to Massachusetts
hospitals, that there are now in active life, in
that state alone, 1500 persons who will, within the

<p><span class="caption">Frequency of Locomotor Ataxia and General
Paralysis.</span>&mdash;The percentage of all syphilitic patients
who develop either locomotor ataxia or paresis varies
in different estimates from 1 to 6 per cent of the
total number who acquire syphilis. The susceptibility<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
to any syphilitic disease of the nervous system
is hastened by the use of alcohol and by overwork or
dissipation, so that the prevalence of them depends
on the class of patients considered. It is evident,
though, that only a relatively small proportion of
the total number of syphilitics are doomed to either
of these fates. Taking the population as a whole,
the percentage of syphilitics who develop this form
of late involvement probably does not greatly exceed
1 per cent.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Treatment and Prevention of Late Syphilis of the
Nervous System.</span>&mdash;Locomotor ataxia and paresis,
even more than other syphilitic diseases of the nervous
system, are extremely hard to affect by medicines
circulating in the blood, and for that reason do not
respond to treatment with the ease that syphilis
does in many other parts of the body. Early locomotor
ataxia can often be benefited or kept from
getting any worse by the proper treatment. For
paresis, in our present state of knowledge, nothing
can be done once the disease passes its earliest
stages. In both these diseases only too often the
physician is called upon to lock the stable door after
the horse is stolen. The problem of what to do for
the victims of these two conditions is the same as the
problem in other serious complications of syphilis&mdash;keep
the disease from ever reaching such a stage by
recognizing every case early, and treating it thoroughly
from the very beginning.</p>

<h4 class="smcap">Summary</h4>

<p>Summing up briefly the main points to bear in
mind about the course of syphilis&mdash;there is a time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
at the very beginning of the disease, even after the
first sore appears, when the condition is still at or
near the place where it entered the body. At this
time it can be permanently cured by quick recognition
and thorough treatment. There are no fixed
characteristics of the early stages of the disease, and
it often escapes attention entirely or is regarded as a
trifle. The symptoms that follow the spread of the
disease over the body may be severe or mild, but
they seldom endanger life, and again often escape
notice, leaving the victim for some years a danger
to other people from relapses about which he may
know nothing whatever. Serious syphilis is the late
syphilis which overtakes those whose earlier symptoms
passed unrecognized or were insufficiently
treated. Late syphilis of the skin and bones, disfiguring
and horrible to look at, is less dangerous
than the hidden syphilis of the blood-vessels, the
nerves, and the internal organs, which, under cover of
a whole skin and apparent health, maims and destroys
its victims. Locomotor ataxia and softening
of the brain, early apoplexy, blindness and deafness,
paralysis, chronic fatal kidney and liver disease,
heart failure, hardening of the blood-vessels early
in life, with sudden or lingering death from any of
these causes, are among the ways in which syphilis
destroys innocent and guilty alike. And yet, for
all its destructive power, it is one of the easiest of
diseases to hold in check, and if intelligently treated
at almost any but the last stages, can, in the great
majority of cases, be kept from endangering life.</p>

<h3>The Blood Test for Syphilis</h3>

<p>It seems desirable at this point, while we are trying
to fix in mind the great value of recognizing
syphilis in a person in order to treat it and thus
prevent dangerous complications, to say something
about the blood test for syphilis, the second great
advance in our means of recognizing doubtful or
hidden forms of the disease. The first, it will be
recalled, is the identification of the germ in the secretions
from the early sores.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Antibodies in the Blood in Disease.</span>&mdash;It is part of
the new understanding we have of many diseases
that we are able to recognize them by finding in the
blood of the sick person substances which the body
makes to neutralize or destroy the poisons made by
the invading germs, even when we cannot find the
germs themselves. These substances are called antibodies,
and the search for antibodies in different
diseases has been an enthusiastic one. If we can by
any scheme teach the body to make antibodies for a
germ, we can teach it to cure for itself the disease
caused by that germ. So, for example, by injecting
dead germs as a vaccine in typhoid fever and certain
other diseases, we are able to teach the body to
form protective substances which will kill any of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
living germs of that particular kind which gain entrance
to the body. Conversely, if the body is invaded
by a particular kind of germ, and we are in
doubt as to just which one it is, we can identify it
by finding in the blood of the sick person the antibody
which we know by certain tests will kill or
injure a certain germ. This sort of medical detective
work was first applied to syphilis successfully by
Wassermann, Neisser, and Bruck in 1904, and for
that reason the test for these antibodies in the blood
in syphilis is called the Wassermann reaction. To
be sure, it is now known that in syphilis it is not a
true antibody for the poisons of the Spiroch&aelig;ta pallida
for which we are testing, but rather a physical-chemical
change in the serum of patients with syphilis,
which can be produced by other things besides
this one disease. But this fact has not impaired the
practical value of the test, since the other conditions
which give it are not likely to be confused with syphilis
in this part of the world. The fact that no true
antibody is formed simply makes it unlikely that
we shall ever have a vaccine for syphilis.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Difficulties of the Test.</span>&mdash;The Wassermann blood
test for syphilis is one of the most complex tests in
medicine. The theory of it is beyond the average
man's comprehension. A large number of factors
enter into the production of a correct result, and the
attaining of that result involves a high degree of
technical skill and a large experience. It is no affair
for the amateur. The test should be made by a
specialist of recognized standing, and this term does
not include many of the commercial laboratories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
which spring up like mushrooms in these days of
laboratory methods.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Recognition of Syphilis by the Blood Test.</span>&mdash;When
the Wassermann test shows the presence of
syphilis, we speak of it as "positive." Granted that
the test is properly done, a strong positive reaction
means syphilis, unless it is covered by the limited
list of exceptions. After the first few weeks of the
disease, and through the early secondary period, the
blood test is positive in practically all cases. Its
reliability is, therefore, greatest at this time. Before
the infection has spread beyond the first sore,
however, the Wassermann test is negative, and this
fact makes it of little value in recognizing early
primary lesions. In about 20 to 30 per cent of
syphilitic individuals the test returns to negative
after the active secondary stage is passed. This
does not necessarily mean that the person is recovering.
It is even possible to have the roof fall out of the
mouth from gummatous changes and the Wassermann
test yet be negative. It is equally possible,
though unusual, for a negative Wassermann test to
be coincident with contagious sores in the mouth or
on the genitals. So it is apparent that as an infallible
test for syphilis it is not an unqualified success.
But infallibility is a rare thing in medicine,
and must be replaced in most cases by skilful interpretation
of a test based on a knowledge of the
sources of error. We understand pretty clearly
now that the Wassermann test is only one of the
signs of syphilis and that it has quite well-understood
limitations. It has revealed an immense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
amount of hidden syphilis, and in its proper field
has had a value past all counting. Experience has
shown, however, that it should be checked up by a
medical examination to give it its greatest value.
Just as all syphilis does not show a positive blood
test, so a single negative test is not sufficient to
establish the absence of syphilis without a medical
examination. In a syphilitic, least of all, is a single
negative Wassermann test proof that his syphilis
has left him. In spite of these rather important
exceptions, the Wassermann test, skilfully done and
well interpreted, is one of the most valuable of modern
medical discoveries.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Blood Test in the Treatment and Cure of
Syphilis.</span>&mdash;In addition to its value in recognizing the
disease, the Wassermann test has a second field of
usefulness in determining when a person is cured of
syphilis, and is an excellent guide to the effect of
treatment. Good treatment early in a case of
syphilis usually makes the Wassermann test negative
in a comparatively short time, and even a little
treatment will do it in some cases. But will it stay
negative if treatment is then stopped? In the high
percentage of cases it will not. It will become positive
again after a variable interval, showing that the
disease has been suppressed but not destroyed. For
that reason, if we wish to be sure of cure, we must
continue treatment until the blood test has become
negative and stays negative. This usually means
repeated tests, over a period of several years, in connection
with such a course of treatment as will be
described later. During a large part of this time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the blood test will be the only means of finding out
how the disease is being affected by the treatment.
To all outward appearance the patient will be well.
He may even have been negative in repeated tests,
and yet we know by experience that if treatment is
stopped too soon, he will become positive again.
There is no set rule for the number of negative tests
necessary to indicate a cure. The whole thing is a
matter of judgment on the part of an experienced
physician, and to that judgment the patient should
commit himself unhesitatingly. If a patient could
once have displayed before him in visible form
the immense amount of knowledge, experience, and
labor which has gone into the devising and goes into
the performing of this test, he would be more content
to leave the decision of such questions to his physician
than he sometimes is, and would be more alive
to its reality and importance. The average man
thinks it a rather shadowy and indefinite affair on
which to insist that he shall keep on doctoring, especially
after the test has been negative once or
twice.</p>

<p>Just as a negative test may occur while syphilis is
still actively present and doing damage in the body,
so a positive Wassermann test may persist long after
all outward and even inward signs of the disease
have disappeared. These fixed positives are still
a puzzle to physicians. But many patients with
fixed positives, if well treated regardless of their
blood test, do not seem to develop the late accidents
of the disease. If their nervous systems, on careful
examination, are found not to be affected, they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
reasonably safe as far as our present knowledge goes.
People with fixed positives should accept the judgment
of their physicians and follow their recommendations
for treatment without worrying themselves
gray over complications which may never develop.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Practical Points About the Test.</span>&mdash;Certain practical
details about this test are of interest to every
one. Blood for it is usually drawn from a small
vein in the arm. The discomfort is insignificant&mdash;no
more than that of a sharp pin-prick. Blood is
drawn in the same way for other kinds of blood tests,
so that a needle-prick in the arm is not necessarily
for a Wassermann test. There is no cutting and no
scar remains. The amount of blood drawn is small
and does not weaken one in the least. The test is
done on the serum or fluid part of the blood, after
the corpuscles are removed. It can also be done on
the clear fluid taken from around the spinal cord,
and this is necessary in certain syphilitic nervous
diseases. There is nothing about the test that need
make anybody hesitate in taking it, and it is safe to
say that, when properly done, the information that
it gives is more than worth the trouble, especially to
those who have at any time been exposed, even remotely,
to the risk of infection. But the test must
be well done, by a large hospital or through a competent
physician or specialist, and the results interpreted
to the patient by the physician and not by
the laboratory that does the test, or in the light of
the patient's own half-knowledge of the matter.</p>

<h3>The Treatment of Syphilis</h3>

<h4 class="smcap">General Considerations</h4>

<p><span class="caption">Scientific Methods of Treating Disease.</span>&mdash;In trying
to treat diseases caused by germs, the physician
finds himself confronted by several different problems.
Certain of these diseases run their course and
the patient gets well or dies, pretty much regardless
of anything that can be done for him. In certain
others, because of our knowledge of the way in which
the body makes its fight against the germ, we are
able either to prepare it against attack, as in the case
of protective vaccination, or we are able to help it
to come to its own defense after the disease has developed.
This can be done either by supplying it
with antitoxin from an outside source, or helping it
to make its own antitoxin by giving it dead germs to
practise on. In the third group, the smallest of the
three, we are fortunate enough to know of some substance
which will kill the germ in the body without
killing the patient. For such diseases we are said
to have a "specific" method of treatment. Syphilis
is one of these diseases. It is not to be understood
that there is a sharp line of division between these
three groups, since in every disease we try as far as
possible to use all the methods we can bring to bear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
In pneumonia we have to let the body largely make
its own fight, and simply help it to clear out the
poisons formed by the germ, and keep the heart
going until the crisis is past. In diphtheria, nowadays,
we help the body out promptly by supplying
it with antitoxin from an outside source, before it
has time to make any for itself. We do the same
thing for lockjaw if we are early enough. We practise
the body on dead typhoid germs by vaccination
until it is able to fight the living ones and destroy
them before they get a foothold. The diseases for
which we have specific methods of treatment are few
in number, and each has associated with it the name
of a particular drug. Quinin kills the germ of malaria,
sodium salicylate cures inflammatory rheumatism,
and mercury cures syphilis. To mercury
in the case of syphilis must now be added salvarsan
or arsenobenzol ("606"), the substance devised by
Ehrlich in 1910, which will be considered in the next
chapter.</p>

<p>The action of a specific is, of course, not infallible,
but the failures are exceptional, so that one feels
in attacking one of these diseases with its specific
remedy as a man called upon to resist a savage beast
would feel if he were armed with a powerful rifle
instead of a stick. The situation in syphilis, for
which there is a specific, as compared with tuberculosis,
for which there is no specific, is incomparably
in favor of the former. If we had as powerful
weapons against tuberculosis as we have against
syphilis, the disease would now be a rarity instead
of the disastrous plague it is. Comparing the situation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
in two diseases for which we have specifics, such
as syphilis and malaria, malaria has lost most of its
seriousness as a problem in any part of the world,
while syphilis is rampant everywhere. Malaria has,
of course, been extinguished not only through the
efficiency of quinin, but also through preventive
measures directed at mosquitos, which are the carriers
of the disease from person to person. But
allowing for this, if it becomes possible to apply
mercury and salvarsan as thoroughly to the prevention
and treatment of syphilis as quinin can be
applied to malaria, syphilis will soon be a rarity
over the larger part of the civilized world. To bring
the specific remedies for syphilis and the patient
together constitutes, then, one of the greatest problems
which confronts us in the control of the disease
at the present day.</p>

<h4 class="smcap">Mercury</h4>

<p><span class="caption">Mercury in the Treatment of Syphilis.</span>&mdash;Mercury
is, of course, familiar to every one, and there is nothing
peculiar about the mercury used in the treatment
of syphilis. The fluid metallic mercury itself
may be used in the form of salves, in which the
mercury is mixed with fatty substances and rubbed
into the skin. Mercury can be vaporized and the
vapor inhaled, and probably the efficiency of mercury
when rubbed into the skin depends to no small
extent on the inhalation of the vapor which is driven
off by the warmth of the body. Mercury in the
form of chemical salts or compounds with other substances
can be given as pills or as liquid medicine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Similarly, the metal itself or some of its compounds
can be injected in oil with a hypodermic needle into
the muscles, and the drug absorbed in this way.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Misconceptions Concerning Mercury.</span>&mdash;The use of
mercury in syphilis is nearly as old, in Europe at
least, as the disease itself. The drug was in common
use in the fifteenth century for other conditions, and
was promptly tried in the new and terrible disease
as it spread over Europe, with remarkable results.
But doses in the old days were anything but homeopathic,
and overdoses of mercury did so much damage
that for a time the drug fell into undeserved
disfavor. Many of the superstitions and popular
notions about mercury originated at this period in
its history. It was supposed to make the bones
"rot" and the teeth fall out, an idea which one
patient in every ten still entertains and offers as an
objection when told he must take mercury. Insufficiently
treated syphilis is, of course, what makes
the bones "rot," and not the mercury used in treating
the disease. Mercury apparently has no effect
on the bones whatever. The influence of the drug
on the teeth is more direct and refers to the symptoms
caused by overdoses. No physician who knows
his business ever gives mercury at the present time
to the point where the teeth are in any danger of
falling out.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Action of Mercury.</span>&mdash;The action of mercury
on syphilis is not entirely clear. The probabilities
are that the drug, carried to all parts of the body by
the blood, helps to build up the body's resistance and
stimulates it to produce substances which kill the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
germs. In addition, of course, it kills the germs by
its own poisonous qualities. Its action is somewhat
slow, and it is even possible for syphilitic sores containing
the germs to appear, especially in the mouth
and throat and about the genitals, while the person
is taking mercury. Just as quinin must be used in
malaria for some time after all signs of chill and fever
have disappeared, to kill off all germs lurking in
out-of-the-way corners of the body, or especially resistant
to the drug, so it is necessary to continue the
use of mercury long after it has disposed of all the
obvious signs of the disease, like the eruption, headaches,
and other symptoms, in order to prevent a
relapse. No matter in what form it is used, the
action of mercury on syphilis is one of the marvels of
medicine. It can clear up the most terrific eruption
with scarcely a scar, and transform a bed-ridden
patient into a seemingly healthy man or woman,
able to work, in the course of a few weeks or months.
Symptoms often vanish before it like snow in a
thaw. This naturally makes a decided impression,
and often an unfavorable one, on the patient. It is
only too easy to think that a disease which vanishes
under the magic influence of a few pills is a trifle,
and that outwardly cured means the same thing as
inwardly cured. Mercury therefore carries its disadvantages
with its advantages, and by its marvelous
but transient effect only too often gives the patient
a false idea of his progress toward cure.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Methods of Administering Mercury.</span>&mdash;As has been
said, mercury is given principally in three ways at
the present time. It can be given by the mouth, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the form of pills and liquids, and in this form is not
infrequently incorporated into patent medicine blood
purifiers. Mercury in pills and liquid medicine has
the advantage for the patient of being an easy and
inconspicuous way of taking the drug, and for that
reason patients usually take it willingly or even insist
on it if they know no better. Even small doses
taken in this way will hide the evidences of syphilis
so completely that only a blood test will show that
it exists. If it were true that large doses taken by
mouth could always be relied on to cure the disease,
there would be little need for other ways of giving
it. But there is a considerable proportion of persons
with syphilis treated with pills who do not get rid
of the disease even though the dose is as large as the
stomach can stand. Such patients often have all
the serious late complications which befall untreated
patients. It seems almost impossible to give enough
mercury by mouth to effect a cure. Thus pill treatment
has come to be a second-best method, and suitable
only in those instances in which we simply expect
to control the outward signs rather than effect a
cure.</p>

<p>The mercury rub or inunction, under ideal conditions,
all things considered, is the best method of
administering mercury to a patient with the hope of
securing a permanent result. In this form of treatment
the mercury made up with a salve is rubbed
into the skin. The effectiveness of the mercurial
rub is reduced considerably by its obvious disadvantages.
It requires time to do the rubbing, and
the ointment used seems uncleanly because of its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
color and because it is necessary to leave what is not
rubbed in on the skin so that it discolors the underwear.
The mercurial rub is at its best when it is
given by some one else, since few patients have the
needed combination of conscientiousness, energy, and
determination to carry through a long course. The
advantages of the method properly carried out cannot
be overestimated. It is entirely possible in a
given case of syphilis to accomplish by a sufficient
number of inunctions everything that mercury
can accomplish, and with the least possible damage
to the body. Treatment by mouth cannot compare
with inunctions and cannot be made to replace them,
when the only objection to the rubs is the patient's
unwillingness to be bothered by them. The patient
who is determined, therefore, to do the best thing
by himself will take rubs conscientiously as long as
his physician wishes him to do so, even though it
means, as it usually does, not a dozen or two, but
several hundreds of them, extending over a period
of two or three years, and given at the rate of four
to six rubs a week.</p>

<p>The giving of mercury by injections is a very
powerful method of using the drug for the cure of
syphilis. It reduces the inconvenience of effective
treatment to a minimum and has all the other advantages
of secrecy and convenience. It keeps the
patient, moreover, in close touch with his physician
and under careful observation. Injections by some
methods are given daily, by others once or twice a
week. The main disadvantage is the discomfort
which follows each injection for a few hours. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
any one who has one of the serious complications of
syphilis, injections may be a life and death necessity.
Mercurial injections are a difficult form of treatment
and should be given only by experts and physicians
who are thoroughly familiar with their use.</p>

<p>Like every important drug in medicine, mercury
is a poison if it is abused. Its earliest effect is on the
mouth and teeth, and for that reason the physician,
in treating syphilis by vigorous methods, has his
patients give special attention to the care of their
mouths and teeth and of their digestions as well.
Mercury also affects the kidneys and the blood, if
not properly given, and for that reason the person
who is taking it must be under the care and observation
of a physician from time to time. Only the
ignorant undertake to treat themselves for syphilis,
though how many of these there are can be inferred
from the amount of patent medicine and quack treatment
there is in these fields. Properly given, mercury
has no harmful effects, and there is no ground
whatever for the notion some people have, that mercury
will do them more harm than a syphilitic infection.
Improperly used, either as too much or
too little, it is capable of doing great harm, not only
directly, but indirectly, by making it impossible
later for the patient to take enough to cure the disease.
The extent to which some overconfident
persons fail in their efforts to treat and cure themselves
explains the necessity for such a warning.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Effect of Mercurial Treatment on the Blood Test.</span>&mdash;The
effect of mercury on the Wassermann blood
test for syphilis should also be generally understood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
In many cases it is possible, especially early in the
disease, by a few rubs of mercurial ointment, or a
few injections of mercury, or even in some cases by
the use of pills or liquid medicine, to make a positive
blood test for syphilis negative. But this negative
test is only temporary. Within a short time, usually
after treatment is stopped, the test becomes positive
again, showing that the mercury has not yet
cured, but simply checked, the disease, and that it
may at any time break out again or do internal
damage. It must be understood that a negative
blood test just after a patient has been taking mercury
<i>has no meaning</i>, so far as guaranteeing a cure
is concerned. It is only the blood test that is repeatedly
negative after the effect of mercury wears
off, which shows the disease is cured. Yet many a
syphilitic may and does think himself cured, and
may marry in good faith, or be allowed a health
certificate, only to become positive again. He may
then develop new sores without his knowledge even,
and perhaps infect his wife, or may himself in later
years develop some of the serious consequences of
the disease.</p>

<p>Whenever one talks to a person who knows something
about the advances in knowledge in the past
few years about the treatment of syphilis, and goes
into detail about mercury, the odds are two to one
that he will be interrupted by the question, "But
what about '606'?" Before talking about salvarsan,
or "606," it is well to say here that this new drug,
wonderful though it is, has in no sense done away
with the necessity for the use of mercury in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
treatment of syphilis. Mercury has as high a reputation
and is as indispensable in the cure of syphilis
today as it was four centuries ago. It has as yet
no substitutes. We appreciate every day, more and
more, how thoroughly it can be depended on to do
the work we ask of it.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
A drug known as the iodid of potash (or soda) is widely used in the
treatment of syphilis, and especially of the late forms of the disease,
such as gummas and gummatous sores. It has a peculiar effect on
gummatous tissue, causing it to melt away, so to speak, and greatly hastening
the healing process. So remarkable is this effect that it gives
the impression that iodids are really curing the syphilis itself. It has
been shown, however, that iodids have no effect on the germs of syphilis,
and therefore on the cause of the disease, although they can promote
the healing of the sores in the late stages. For this reason iodids must
always be used in connection with mercury or salvarsan if the disease
itself is to be influenced. It is occasionally difficult to get patients to
understand this after they have once taken "drops," as the medicine is
often called. Otherwise the use of iodids in syphilis is of medical rather
than general interest.</p></div>

<h3>The Treatment of Syphilis (Continued)</h3>

<h4 class="smcap">Salvarsan</h4>

<p><span class="caption">The Discovery of Salvarsan ("606").</span>&mdash;Salvarsan,
or "606," is a chemical compound used in the modern
treatment of syphilis. It was announced to the
world by Paul Ehrlich, its brilliant discoverer, in
December, 1910. Ehrlich and his Japanese co-worker,
Hata, had some years before been impressed
with the remarkable effect certain dyes had on the
parasites infesting certain animals and which resemble
the germs that cause the African sleeping
sickness in man. When one of these dyes was dissolved
and injected into the blood of the sick animal,
the dye promptly picked out and killed all the parasites,
but did not kill the animal. Dyes are very
complex chemical substances and certain of them
seem to have an affinity for germs. It occurred to
Ehrlich that if a substance could be devised which
was poisonous for the germ and not for the patient
it might be possible to prepare a specific for a given
disease, acting as quinin does in malaria. By
combining a poison with a dye it might be made to
pick out the germs and leave the body unharmed.</p>

<p>The poison which had already been shown to be
especially effective in killing germs like those of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
syphilis was arsenic. The problem was to get arsenic
into such a combination with other chemical
substances that it would lose its poisonous quality
for man, but still be poisonous for the spirochete of
syphilis. Ehrlich and Hata began to make chemical
compounds of arsenic in the laboratory with chemical
substances like the dyes. As the compounds
grew more complex they were tested on animals and
some of them found to have the qualities for which
their inventors were searching. Some of them are
even used at the present time in the treatment of
certain diseases. The six hundred and sixth compound
in this series, when tested on syphilitic animals,
was found to be extraordinarily efficient in
killing the germ of syphilis, even when used in quantities
so small as not to injure the animal. Among
other things, there could be no better example of the
importance of animal experiment in medicine. If
the cause of syphilis had not been known, and the
disease not given to animals, the discovery of salvarsan
might never have been made. After extensive
experiments on syphilitic rabbits, which
showed that the drug could be given safely in
amounts large enough to cure the animal at a single
dose, it was tried on man, two physicians, Drs.
Hoppe and Wittneben, volunteering for the test.
When it was found that the drug did them no harm,
it was used on syphilitic patients for the first time.
As soon as its remarkable effect on the disease in
them was fully established, Ehrlich announced the
discovery before the medical society of Magdeburg,
and the results were published in one of the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
important of the German medical journals. Ehrlich
then sent out from his own laboratory several
thousands of doses of the new drug to all the principal
clinics and large hospitals of the world for an
extended trial. It was not until the results of this
trial became apparent that he permitted its manufacture
on a commercial scale. There could scarcely
be a more ideal way of introducing a new form of
treatment than the one adopted by Ehrlich, or one
better surrounded by all the safeguards that conservatism
could suggest.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Mistaken Conception of "Single Dose Cure."</span>&mdash;In
the light of his experience with salvarsan in
animals, Ehrlich hoped to accomplish the cure of
syphilis in man by a single dose of the new drug, as
he had been able to cure it in rabbits. All the earlier
use of salvarsan in the treatment of syphilis was
carried out with this idea in view, and the remarkable
way in which the symptoms vanished before the
large doses used encouraged the belief that Ehrlich's
ideal for it had been fulfilled. But it was not long
before it was found that syphilis had a stronger hold
on the human body than on animals, and that patients
relapsed after a single dose, either as shown by
the blood test or by the reappearance, after varying
intervals, of the eruption or other symptoms of the
disease. Unfortunately, the news of the discovery
of salvarsan, and with it Ehrlich's original idea that
it would cure syphilis by a single dose, had gotten
into the newspapers. Numbers of syphilitics treated
with it have been deceived by this notion into believing
themselves cured. In those whose symptoms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
came back in severe form, the trouble was, of course,
found out. But there are at the present time, undoubtedly,
many persons who received a single dose
of salvarsan for a syphilis contracted at this time,
and who today, having never seen any further outward
signs of the disease, believe themselves cured,
when in reality they are not. In the next twenty
years the introduction of salvarsan will probably
result in a wave of serious late syphilis, the result of
cases insufficiently treated in the early days of its
use. It was not long before it was found that not
one but several doses of salvarsan were necessary in
the treatment of syphilis, and soon many physicians
of wide experience began to call in mercury again
for help when salvarsan proved insufficient for cure.
At the present time the use of both mercury and
salvarsan in the treatment of the disease is the most
widely accepted practice, and seems to offer the
greatest assurance of cure.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Value of Salvarsan.</span>&mdash;Salvarsan has done for
the treatment of syphilis certain things of the most
far-reaching importance from the standpoint of the
interests of society at large. It has first of all made
possible the control of the <i>contagious</i> lesions of the
disease. Secondly, as was said before, it has made
possible the cure of the infection in the primary stage,
before it has spread from the starting-point in the
chancre to the rest of the body. To understand how
it accomplishes these results it is important to understand
its mode of action.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Action of Salvarsan.</span>&mdash;It will be recalled that
Ehrlich planned salvarsan to kill the germs of syphilis,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
just as quinin kills the germs of malaria. It
was intended that when the drug entered the blood
it should be carried to every part of the body, and
fastening itself on the spirochetes, kill them without
hurting the body. This is seemingly exactly what
the drug does, and it does it so well that within
twenty-four hours after a dose of it is given into the
blood there is not a living germ of syphilis, apparently,
in any sore on the body. If the same thing
happened in all the out-of-the-way corners of the
body, the cure would be complete. The natural
result of removing the cause of the disease in this
fashion is that the sores produced by it heal up.
They heal with a speed and completeness that is an
even greater marvel than the action of mercury.
The more superficial the eruption, the quicker it
vanishes, so that in the course of a few days all evidence
of the disease may disappear. This is especially
true of the grayish patches in the mouth and
about the genitals, which have already been described
as the most dangerously contagious lesions of syphilis.
It is evident, therefore, that to give salvarsan
in a case of contagious syphilis is to do away with the
risk of spreading the disease in the quickest and most
effective fashion. It is as if a person with scarlet
fever could be dipped in a disinfecting bath and then
turned loose in the community without the slightest
danger of his infecting others. How much scarlet
fever would there be if every case of the disease could
be treated in this way? There would be as little
of it as there now is of smallpox, compared to the
wholesale plagues of that disease which used to kill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
off the population of whole towns and counties in the
old days. If we could head off the crops of contagious
sores in every syphilitic by the use of "606,"
syphilis in the same way would take a long step
toward its disappearance. It is not a question, in
this connection, of curing the disease with salvarsan,
but of preventing its spread, and in doing that, salvarsan
is one of the things we have been looking for
for centuries.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Treatment of Syphilis With Salvarsan.</span>&mdash;Salvarsan,
the original "606," was improved on by
Ehrlich in certain ways, which make it easier for
the ordinary physician to use it. The improved
salvarsan is called neosalvarsan ("914") and has no
decided advantages over the older preparation except
on the score of convenience. Both salvarsan
and neosalvarsan are yellow powders, which must
be manufactured under the most exacting precautions,
to prevent their being intensely poisonous, and
must be sealed up in glass tubes to prevent their
spoiling in the air. They were formerly administered
by dissolving them or by mixing with oil and
then injecting them into the muscles, much as mercury
is given by injection. At the present time,
however, the majority of experts prefer to dissolve
the drug in water or salt solution and to inject it into
the blood directly, through one of the arm veins.
There is very little discomfort in the method, as a
rule&mdash;no more than there is to the taking of blood for
a blood test. At the present time the quantity of the
drug injected is relatively small for the first injection,
growing larger with each following injection. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
intervals between injections vary a good deal, but a
week is an average. The number of injections that
should be given depends largely on the purpose in
view. If the salvarsan is relied on to produce a cure,
the number may be large&mdash;as high as twenty or more.
If it is used only to clear up a contagious sore, a
single injection may be enough for the time being.
But when only a few injections are used, mercury
becomes the main reliance, and a patient who cannot
have all the salvarsan he needs should not expect
two or three doses of it to produce a cure. The
publicity which has been given to this form of treatment
has led many patients to take matters into their
own hands and to go to a physician and ask him to
give them a dose of salvarsan, much as they might
order a highball on a cold day. The physician who
is put in a position like this is at a disadvantage in
caring for his patient, and the patient in the end pays
for his mistaken idea that he knows what is good for
himself. The only judge of the necessity of giving
salvarsan, and the amount and the frequency with
which to give it, is the expert physician, and no patient
who is wise will try to take the thing into his
own hands. There are even good reasons for believing
that the patient who is insufficiently treated
with salvarsan is at times worse off than the patient
who, unable to afford the drug at all, has had to depend
for his cure entirely on mercury.</p>

<p>It is one of the tragedies of the modern private
practice of medicine that the physician has so often
to consult the patient's purse in giving or withholding
salvarsan, and for that reason, except in the well-to-do,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
it is seldom used to the best advantage. Such
a drug, so powerful an agent in the conservation of
the public health, should be available to all who need
it in as large amounts as necessary, without a moment's
hesitation as to whether the patient can afford
it or not. It is not too much to urge that private
patent rights should not be allowed to control the
price and distribution of such a commodity to the
public. Upon the payment of suitable royalties to
the inventor the manufacture of such a drug should
be thrown open to properly supervised competition,
as in the case of diphtheria antitoxin, or be taken
over by the Government and distributed at cost, at
least to hospitals. To bring about such a revision
of our patent law every thinking man and woman
may well devote a share of personal energy and influence.</p>

<p>The manner of giving salvarsan is as important
for the patient as the correct performance of an
operation, and the safeguards which surround it are
essentially the same. The drug is an extremely
powerful one, more powerful than any other known,
and in the usual doses it carries with it into the body
for the destruction of the germs of syphilis many
times the amount of arsenic needed to kill a human
being. If something should go astray, the patient
might lose his life as promptly as if the surgeon or
the anesthetist should make a slip during an operation.
To make the giving of salvarsan safe, the
judgment, experience, and training of the specialist
are not too much to ask.</p>

<p>The dangers of salvarsan are easily exaggerated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
and some people have a foolish fear of it. The
wonderful thing about the drug is that, with all the
possibility for harm that one might expect in it, it
so seldom makes any trouble. It is, of course, first
carefully tested on animals when it is manufactured,
so that no poisonous product is placed on the market.
It is as safe to take salvarsan at the hands of an expert
as it is to take ether for an operation or to take
antitoxin for diphtheria, and that is saying a good
deal. Most of the stories of accidents that go the
rounds among laymen date back to the days when
first doses were too large and made the patients
rather sick for a time. Present methods and cautions
about administering the drug are such that,
except for the improvement in their condition, patients
seldom know they have received it. The
first dose may light the eruption up a little, but this
is only because the drug stirs the germs up before it
kills them, and improvement begins promptly within
a few hours or a day or two.</p>

<p>The first characteristic of salvarsan which we
should bear in mind especially, in our interest in the
social aspects of syphilis, is then the rapidity rather
than the thoroughness of its action. It is a social
asset to us because it protects us from the infected
person, and it is an asset to the patient because it
will set him on his feet, able to work and go about his
business, in a fraction of the time that mercury can
do it.</p>

<p>The efficiency of salvarsan in the cure of syphilis
in the early stages is due, first, to the large amount
of it that can be introduced into the body without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
killing the patient, and second, to the promptness
with which it gets to the source of trouble. In the
old days, while we were laboriously getting enough
mercury into the patient to help him to stop the
invading infection, the germs marched on into his
blood and through his body. With salvarsan, the
first dose, given into the blood, reaches the germs
forthwith and destroys them. There is enough of it
and to spare. Twenty-four hours later scarcely a
living germ remains. The few stragglers who escape
the fate of the main army are picked up by
subsequent doses of salvarsan and mercury, and a
cure is assured. There is all the difference between
stopping a charge with a machine gun and stopping
it with a single-shot rifle, in the relative effectiveness
of salvarsan and mercury at the beginning of a
syphilitic infection.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In syphilis affecting the central nervous system, salvarsan, modified
in various ways, may be injected into the spinal canal in an effort to
reach the trouble more directly. The method, which is known as <i>intradural
therapy</i>, has had considerable vogue, but a growing experience with
it seems to indicate that it has less value than was supposed, and is a
last resort more often than anything else. It involves some risk, and is
no substitute for efficient treatment by the more familiar methods. If
necessary, a patient can have the benefit of both.</p>

<p>The <i>luetin test</i> was devised by Noguchi for the presence of syphilis, and
is performed by injecting into the skin an emulsion of dead germs. A
pustule forms if the test is positive. It is of practical value only in late
syphilis, and a negative test is no proof of the absence of the disease.
Positive tests are sometimes obtained when syphilis is not present. For
these reasons the test is not as valuable as was at first thought.</p></div>

<h2><a name="Chapter_IX" id="Chapter_IX"></a>Chapter IX</h2>

<h3>The Cure of Syphilis</h3>

<p>There are few things about our situation with
regard to syphilis that deserve more urgent attention
than questions connected with the cure of the
disease, and few things in which it is harder to get
the necessary co&ouml;peration. On the one hand, syphilis
is one of the most curable of diseases, and on the
other, it is one of the most incurable. At the one
extreme we have the situation in our own hands, at
our own terms&mdash;at the other, we have a record of
disappointing failure. As matters stand now, we
do not cure syphilis. We simply cloak it, gloss it
over, keep it under the surface. Nobody knows how
much syphilis is cured, partly because nobody knows
how much syphilis there really is, and partly because
it is almost an axiom that few, except persons of high
intelligence and sufficient means, stick to treatment
until they can be discharged as cured. Take into
consideration, too, the fact that the older methods
of treating syphilis were scarcely equal to the task
of curing the disease, and it is easy to see why the
idea has arisen, even among physicians, that once a
syphilitic means always a syphilitic, and that the
disease is incurable.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Radical or Complete Cure.</span>&mdash;In speaking of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
cure of syphilis, it is worth while to define the terms
we use rather clearly. It is worth while to speak in
connection with this disease of radical as distinguished
from symptomatic cure. In a radical cure
we clear up the patient so completely that he never
suffers a relapse. In symptomatic cure, which is
not really cure at all, we simply clear up the symptoms
for which he seeks medical advice, without
thought for what he may develop next. Theoretically,
the radical cure of syphilis should mean ridding
the body of every single germ of the disease. Practically
speaking, we have no means of telling with
certainty when this has been done, or as yet, whether
it ever can be done. It may well be that further
study of the disease will show that, especially in fully
developed cases, we simply reduce the infection to
harmlessness, or suppress it, without eradicating the
last few germs. Recent work by Warthin tends to
substantiate this idea. So we are compelled in
practice to limit our conception of radical cure to the
condition in which we have not only gotten rid of
every single symptom of active syphilis in the patient,
but have carried the treatment to the point
where, so far as we can detect in life, he never develops
any further evidence of the disease. He lives
out his normal span of years in the normal way, and
without having his efficiency as a human being
affected by it. In interpreting this ideal for a given
case we should not forget that radical methods of
treating syphilis are new. Only time can pass full
verdict upon them. Yet the efficiency of older
methods was sufficient to control the disease in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
considerable percentage of those affected. There is,
therefore, every reason to believe that radical cure
under the newer methods is a practical and attainable
ideal in an even higher percentage of cases and
offers all the assurance that any reasonable person
need ask for the conduct of life. It should, therefore,
be sought for in every case in which expert judgment
deems it worth while. It cannot be said too often
that prospect of radical cure depends first and foremost
upon the stage of the disease at which treatment
is begun, and that it is unreasonable to judge
it by what it fails to accomplish in persons upon
whom the infection has once thoroughly fastened
itself.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Symptomatic or Incomplete Cure.</span>&mdash;Symptomatic
"cure" is essentially a process of cloaking or glossing
over the infection. It is easy to obtain in the early
stages of the disease, and in a certain sense, the earlier
in the course of the disease such half-way methods
are applied, the worse it is for patient and public.
In the late stages of the disease symptomatic cure of
certain lesions is sometimes justifiable on the score
that damage already done cannot be repaired, the
risk of infecting others is over, and all that can be
hoped for is to make some improvement in the condition.
But applied early, symptomatic methods
whisk the outward evidences temporarily out of
sight, create a false sense of security, and leave the
disease to proceed quietly below the surface, to the
undoing of its victim. Such patients get an entirely
false idea of their condition, and may refuse to
believe that they are not really cured, or may have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
no occasion even to wonder whether they are or not
until they are beyond help. Every statement that
can be made about the danger of syphilis to the public
health applies with full force to the symptomatically
treated early case. Trifling relapses, highly
contagious sores in the mouth, or elsewhere, are not
prevented by symptomatic treatment and pass unnoticed
the more readily because the patient feels
himself secure in what has been done for him. In
the first five years of an inefficiently treated infection,
and sometimes longer, this danger is a very
near and terrible one, to which thousands fall victims
every year, and among them, perhaps, some of
your friends and mine. Dangerous syphilis is imperfectly
treated syphilis, and at any moment it
may confront us in our drawing rooms, in the swimming
pool, across the counter of the store, or in the
milkman, the waitress, the barber. It confronts
thousands of wives and children in the person of
half-cured fathers, infected nurse-maids, and others
intimately associated with their personal life. These
dangers can be effectively removed from our midst
by the substitution of radical for symptomatic
methods and ideals of cure. A person under vigorous
treatment with a view to radical cure, with the observation
of his condition by a physician which that
implies, is nearly harmless. In a reasonable time
he can be made fit even for marriage. The whole
contagious period of syphilis would lose its contagiousness
if every patient and physician refused
to think of anything but radical cure.</p>

<p>In such a demand as this for the highest ideals in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the treatment of a disease like syphilis, the medical
profession must, of course, stand prepared to do its
share toward securing the best results. No one concedes
more freely than the physician himself that, in
the recognition and radical treatment of syphilis,
not all the members of the medical profession are
abreast of the most advanced knowledge of the subject.
Syphilis, almost up to the present day, has
never been adequately taught as part of a medical
training. Those who obtained a smattering of
knowledge about it from half a dozen sources in their
school days were fortunate. Thorough knowledge
of the disease, of the infinite variety of its forms, of
the surest means of recognizing it, and the best
methods of treating it, is only beginning to be available
for medical students at the hands of expert
teachers of the subject. The profession, by the
great advances in the medical teaching of syphilis
in the past ten years, and the greater advances yet
to come, is, however, doing its best to meet its share
of responsibility in preparation for a successful campaign.
The combination of the physician who insists
on curing syphilis, with the patient who insists
on being cured, may well be irresistible.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Factors Influencing the Cure of Syphilis.</span>&mdash;Cost.&mdash;We
must admit that, as matters stand now, few patients
are interested in more than a symptomatic
cure. Yet the increasing demand for blood tests, for
example, shows that they are waking up. Ignorance
of the possibility and necessity for radical cure, and
of the means of obtaining it, explains much of the
indifference which leads patients to disappear from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
their physician's care just as the goal is in sight.
But there is another reason why syphilis is so seldom
cured, and this is one which every forward-looking
man and woman should heed. The cure of syphilis
means from two to four years of medical care. All
of us know the cost of such services for even a brief
illness. A prolonged one often sets the victim
farther back in purse than forward in health. The
better the services which we wish to command in
these days, usually, the greater the cost, and expert
supervision, at least, is desirable in syphilis. It is a
financial impossibility for many of the victims of
syphilis to meet the cost of a radical cure. It is all
they can do to pay for symptomatic care in order to
get themselves back into condition to work. We
cannot then reasonably demand of these patients
that they shall be cured, in the interest of others,
unless we provide them with the means. In talking
about public effort against syphilis, this matter will
be taken up again. We have recognized the obligation
in tuberculosis. Let us now provide for it in
syphilis.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Factors Controlling the Cure of Syphilis&mdash;Stage,
Time, Effective Treatment.</span>&mdash;Three factors enter
into the radical cure of syphilis, upon which the
possibility of accomplishing it absolutely depends.
The first of these concerns the stage of the disease at
which treatment is begun; the second is the time for
which it is kept up; and the third is the co&ouml;peration
of doctor and patient in the use of effective methods
of treatment.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Cure in the Primary Stage.</span>&mdash;It goes almost without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
saying that the prospect of curing a disease is
better the earlier treatment is begun. This is peculiarly
so in syphilis. In the earliest days of the
disease, while the infection is still local and the blood
test negative, the prospects of radical cure are practically
100 per cent. This is the so-called abortive
cure, the greatest gift which salvarsan has made to
our power to fight syphilis. It depends on immediate
recognition of the chancre and immediate and strenuous
treatment. So valuable is it that several physicians
of large experience have expressed the belief
that even in cases in which we are not entirely sure
the first sore is syphilitic, we should undertake an
abortive treatment for syphilis. This view may be
extreme, but it illustrates how enormously worth
while the early treatment of syphilis is.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Cure in the Secondary Stage.</span>&mdash;The estimation of
the prospect of recovery when the secondary symptoms
have appeared and the germs are in the blood
is difficult, owing to the rapid changes in our knowledge
of the disease, which are taking place almost
from day to day. The patient usually presses his
physician for an estimate of his chances, and in such
cases, after carefully explaining why our knowledge
is fallible and subject to change, I usually estimate
that for a patient who will absolutely follow the advice
of an expert, the prospects are well over 90 per
cent good.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Outlook in Late Syphilis.</span>&mdash;After the first year
of the infection is passed, or even six months after
the appearance of the secondary rash, the outlook
for permanent cure begins to diminish and falls rapidly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
from this point on. That means that we are
less and less able to tell where we stand by the tests
we now have.</p>

<p>In the later stages of the disease we are gradually
forced back to symptomatic measures, and are often
rather glad to be able to say to the patient that we
can clear up his immediate trouble without mentioning
anything about his future.</p>

<p>The gist of the first essential, then, is to treat
syphilis early rather than late. If this is done, the
prospect of recovery is better than in many of the
acute fevers, such as scarlet fever, a matter of every
day familiarity, and better, on the whole, than in
such a disease as tuberculosis. <i>Yet this does not mean
that the men or women whose syphilis is discovered only
after a lapse of years, must be abandoned to a hopeless
fate.</i> For them, too, excellent prospects still exist,
and careful, persistent treatment may, in a high percentage
of cases, keep their symptoms under control
for years, if not for the ordinary life-time.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Time Required for Cure.</span>&mdash;Time is the second
vital essential for cure. Here we stand on less certain
ground than in the matter of the stage of the
disease. The time necessary for cure is not a fixed
one, and depends on the individual case. Long experience
has taught us that the cure of syphilis is not
a matter of weeks or months, as patients so often
expect, but of years. For the cure of early primary
syphilis ("abortive" cure) not the most enthusiastic
will discharge a patient short of a year, and the conservative
insist on two years or more of observation
at least. In the fully developed infection in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
secondary stage, three years is a minimum and four
years an average for treatment to produce a cure.
Five years of treatment and observation is not an
uncommon period. In the later stages of the disease,
when we are compelled to give up the ideal of radical
cure, our best advice to syphilitic patients, as to
those with old tuberculosis, is that after they have
had two years of good treatment, they should submit
to examination once or twice a year, and not
grumble if they are called upon to carry life insurance
in the form of occasional short courses of treatment
for the rest of their days.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Efficient Treatment.</span>&mdash;The third essential is efficient
treatment, about the nature of which there is
still some dispute. The controversy, however, is
mainly about details. In the modern methods for
treatment of syphilis both salvarsan and mercury are
used, as a rule, and keep the patient decidedly busy
for the first year taking rubs and injections, and
pretty busy for the second. The patient is not incapacitated
for carrying on his usual work. The
intervals of rest between courses of salvarsan and
mercury are short. In the third year the intervals
of rest grow longer, and in the absence of symptoms
the patient has more chance to forget the trouble.
Here the doctor's difficulties begin, for after two or
three negative blood tests with a clear skin, all but
the most conscientious patients disappear from observation.
These are the ones who may pay later
for the folly of their earlier years.</p>

<p>The aim in syphilis, then, is to crush the disease
at its outset by a vigorous campaign. Not until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
an amount of treatment which experience has shown
to be an average requirement has been given, is it
safe to draw breath and wait to see what the effect
on the enemy has been. Dilatory tactics and compromises
are often more dangerous than giving a
little more than the least amount of treatment possible,
for good measure. This is, of course, always
provided the behavior of the body under the ordeal
of treatment is closely studied and observed by an
expert and that it is not blindly pushed to the point
where injury is done by the medicine rather than the
disease.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Importance of Salvarsan.</span>&mdash;Salvarsan is an
absolute essential in the treatment of those early
infections in which an abortive cure can be hoped
for, and in them it must be begun without a day's
delay. To some extent, the abortive cure of the
disease, with its 100 per cent certainty, will therefore
remain a luxury until the public is aroused to the
necessity of providing it under safe conditions and
without restrictions for all who need it. At all
stages of the disease after the earliest it is an aid,
and a powerful one, but it cannot do the work alone,
as mercury usually can. But though mercury is
efficient, it is slow, and the greater rapidity of action
of salvarsan and its power to control infectious
lesions give it a unique place. The combination of
the two is powerful enough to fully justify the statement
that none of the great scourges of the human
race offers its victim a better prospect of recovery
than does syphilis.</p>

<p>Is a cure worth while? There is only one thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
that is more so, and that is never to have had syphilis
at all. The uncured syphilitic has a sword hanging
over his head. At any day or hour the disease
which he scorned or ignored may crush him, or what
is worse, may crush what is nearest and dearest to
him in the world. It does it with a certainty which
not even the physician who sees syphilis all the time
as his life-work can get callous to. It is gambling
with the cards stacked against one to let a syphilitic
infection go untreated, or treated short of cure. It
is criminal to force on others the risks to which an
untreated syphilitic subjects those in intimate contact
with him.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Meaning of "You are Cured."</span>&mdash;How do we
judge whether a patient is radically cured or not?
Here again we confront the problem of what constitutes
the eradication of the disease. In part we
reckon from long experience, and in part depend
upon the refinement of our modern tests. Repeated
negative Wassermann tests on the blood over several
years, especially after treatment is stopped, are an
essential sign of cure. This must be reinforced, as
a rule, by a searching examination of the nervous
system, including a test on the fluid of the spinal
cord. This is especially necessary when we have
used some of the quick methods of cure, like the abortive
treatment. When we have used the old reliable
course, it is less essential, but desirable. Can we
ever say to a patient in so many words, "Go! you
are cured"? This is the gravest question before
experts on syphilis today, and in all frankness it
must be said that the conservative man will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
answer with an unqualified "Yes." He will reserve
the right to say to the patient that he must from time
to time, in his own interest, be re&euml;xamined for signs
of recurrence, and perhaps from time to time reinforce
his immunity by a course of rubs or a few
mercurial injections. Such a statement is not pessimism,
but merely the same deliberate recognition
of the fallibility of human judgment and the uncertainty
of life which we show when we sleep out-of-doors
after we have been suspected of having tuberculosis,
or when we take out accident or life insurance.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_X" id="Chapter_X"></a>Chapter X</h2>

<h3>Hereditary Syphilis</h3>


<p>It seems desirable, at this point, to take up the
hereditary transmission of syphilis in advance of the
other modes of transmitting the disease, since it is
practically a problem all to itself.</p>

<p>Syphilis is one of the diseases whose transmission
from parent to child is frequent enough to make it a
matter of grave concern. It is, in fact, the great
example of a disease which may be acquired before
birth. Just as syphilis is caused only by a particular
germ, so hereditary syphilis is also due to the same
germ, and occurs as a result of the passage of that
germ from the mother's body through the membranes
and parts connecting the mother and child, into the
child. Hereditary syphilis is not some vague, indefinite
constitutional tendency, but syphilis, as definite
as if gotten from a chancre, though differing in some
of its outward signs.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Transmission of Syphilis From Mother to Child.</span>&mdash;It
is a well-known fact that the mothers of syphilitic
children often seem conspicuously healthy. For a
long time it was believed that the child could have
syphilis and the mother escape infection. The
child's infection was supposed to occur through the
infection of the sperm cells of the father with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
germ of syphilis. When the sperm and the egg
united in the mother's body, and the child developed,
it was supposed to have syphilis contracted from the
father, and the mother was supposed to escape it
entirely in the majority of such cases. This older
idea has been largely given up, chiefly as a result of
the enormous mass of evidence which the Wassermann
test has brought to light about the condition
of mothers who bear syphilitic children, but themselves
show no outward sign of the disease. It is
now generally believed that there is no transmission
of syphilis to the child by its father, the father's
share of responsibility for the syphilis lying in his
having infected the mother. None the less, it must
be conceded that this is still debatable ground, and
that quite recently the belief that syphilis can be
transmitted by the father has been supported on
theoretical grounds by good observers.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Absence of Outward Signs in Syphilitic Mothers.</span>&mdash;The
discovery that the mother of a syphilitic child
has syphilis is of great importance in teaching us
how hereditary syphilis can be avoided by preventing
infection of the mother. It is even more important
to understand because of the difficulty of
convincing the seemingly healthy mother of a syphilitic
child that she herself has the disease and should
be treated for it, or she will have other syphilitic
children. Just why the mother may never have
shown an outward sign of syphilis and yet have the
disease and bear syphilitic children is a question
we cannot entirely answer, any more than we can
explain why all obvious signs of syphilis are absent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
in some patients even without treatment, while
others have one outbreak after another, and are
never without evidence of their infection, unless it is
suppressed by treatment. Probably at least a part
of the explanation lies in the fact, already mentioned,
that syphilis is a milder disease in women than in
men, and has more opportunities for concealing its
identity.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Healthy Children of Syphilitic Mothers.</span>&mdash;If the
mother of a syphilitic child has the disease, is it
equally true that a syphilitic mother can never bear
a healthy child? It certainly is not, especially in the
late years of the disease, after it has spent much of
its force. When the multitudes of germs present
in the secondary period have died out, whether as a
result of treatment or in the normal course of the
disease, a woman who still has syphilis latent in her
or even in active tertiary form, may bear a healthy
child. Such a child may be perfectly healthy in
every particular, and not only not have syphilis,
but show no sign that the mother had the disease.
It is in the period of active syphilis, the three, four,
or five years following her infection, that the syphilitic
mother is most likely to bear syphilitic children.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Non-hereditary Syphilis in Children.</span>&mdash;Syphilis in
children is not always hereditary, even though the
signs of it appear only a short time after birth. A
woman who at the beginning of her pregnancy was
free from the disease, may acquire it while she is
still carrying the child as a result of her husband's
becoming infected from some outside source. The
limitation which pregnancy may put on sexual indulgence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
leads some men to seek sexual gratification
elsewhere than with their wives. The husband becoming
infected, then infects his pregnant wife.
There are no absolute rules about the matter, but if
the mother is not infected until the seventh month
of her pregnancy, the child is likely to escape the
hereditary form of the disease. On the other hand,
imagine the prospects for infection when the child
is born through a birth-canal filled with mucous
patches or with a chancre on the neck of the womb.
Children infected in this way at birth do not develop
the true hereditary form of the disease, but
get the acquired form with a chancre and secondary
period, just as in later life.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Effect of Syphilis on the Child-bearing Woman.</span>&mdash;What
does syphilis mean for the woman who is in
the child-bearing period? In the first place, unlike
gonorrhea, which is apt to make women sterile,
syphilis does not materially reduce the power to
conceive in most cases. A woman with active syphilis
alone may conceive with great frequency, but
she cannot carry her children through to normal
birth. The syphilitic woman usually has a series of
abortions or miscarriages, in which she loses the child
at any time from the first to the seventh or eighth
month. Of course, there are other causes of repeated
miscarriages, but syphilis is one of the commonest,
and the occurrence of several miscarriages in a
woman should usually be carefully investigated.
The miscarriage or abortion occurs because the unborn
child is killed by the germs of the disease, and
is cast out by the womb as if it were a foreign body.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Usually the more active the mother's syphilis, the
sooner the child is infected and killed, and the earlier
in her pregnancy will she abort. Later in the disease
the child may not be infected until well along,
and may die only at the ninth month or just as it is
born. In other words, the rule is that the abortions
are followed later by one or more still births. This
is by no means invariable. The mother may abort
once at the third month, and with the next pregnancy
bear a living syphilitic child. The living
syphilitic children are usually the results of infection
in the later months of the child's life inside its mother,
or are the result of higher resistance to the disease
on the part of the child or of the efficient treatment
of the mother's syphilis.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Variations on the Rule.</span>&mdash;It should never be forgotten
that all these rules are subject to variation,
and that where one woman may have a series of miscarriages
so close together that she mistakes them
for heavy, irregular menstrual flows, and never
realizes she is pregnant, another may bear a living
child the first time after her infection, or still another
woman after one miscarriage may have a child so
nearly normal that it may attain the age of twenty
or older, before it is suspected that it has hereditary
syphilis. Again a woman with syphilis may remain
childless through all the years of her active infection,
and finally, in her first pregnancy, give birth to a
healthy child, even though she still has the disease
in latent form herself. Still another may have a
miscarriage or two and then bear one or two healthy
children, only to have the last child, years after her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
infection, be stillborn and syphilitic. The series
of abortions, followed by stillborn or syphilitic children,
and finally by healthy ones, is only the general
and by no means the invariable rule.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Treatment of the Mother.</span>&mdash;For the mother, then,
syphilis may mean all the disappointments of a
thwarted and defeated maternity, and the horrors
of bearing diseased and malformed children. She is
herself subject to the risk of death from blood poisoning
which may follow abortion. But here, as in
all syphilis, early recognition and thorough treatment
of the disease may totally transform the situation.
In the old days of giving mercury by mouth
and without salvarsan, there was little hope of doing
anything for the children during the active infectious
period in the mother. Now we are realizing
that even while the child is in the womb the vigorous
treatment of the mother may save the day for it,
and bring it into the world with a fair chance for
useful and efficient life. More especially is this true
when the mother has been infected while carrying
the child, or just before or as conception occurred.
In these cases, salvarsan and mercury, carefully
given, seem not only not harmful to mother and
child, but may entirely prevent the child's getting
the disease. For this reason every maternity hospital
or ward should be in a position to make good
Wassermann blood tests, conduct expert examinations,
and give thorough treatment to women who
are found to have syphilis. There does not seem to
be any good reason why a Wassermann test should
not be made part of the examination which every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
intelligent mother expects a physician to make at
the beginning of her pregnancy. Such a test would
bring to light some otherwise undiscovered syphilis,
and protect the lives of numbers of mothers and
children whose health and happiness, not to say life,
are now sacrificed to blind ignorance.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Effect of Hereditary Syphilis on the Unborn Child.</span>&mdash;In
the effect of hereditary syphilis on the child,
we see the most direct illustration of the deteriorating
influence of the disease on the race. Here again
we must allow for wide variation, dependent on circumstances
and on differences in the course of the
disease. This does not, however, conceal the tragedy
expressed in the statement that, under anything
but the most expert care, more than 75 per cent of
the children born with syphilis die within the first
year of life. Good estimates show that more often
95 per cent than fewer of untreated children die.
Such figures as those of Still are not at all exceptional&mdash;of
187 children of syphilitic parents, born or unborn,
113 were lost, whether by miscarriage, still-birth,
or in spite of treatment after they were born.
It is estimated that not more than 28 per cent of
syphilitic children survive their first year. Those
that survive the first year seem to have a fighting
chance for life. Statistics based on over 100,000
cases show that about one child in every 148 from
two to twelve years of age has hereditary syphilis.
Realizing the difficulty in recognizing the disease by
examination alone, it is entirely safe to suppose that
the actual figures are probably higher. The statistics<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
given at least illustrate how few syphilitic children
survive to be included in such an estimate.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Moral Effect on the Parents.</span>&mdash;The real extent of
the damage done by the disease as a cause of death
in infancy is scarcely appreciated from figures alone.
There is something more to be reckoned with, which
comes home to every man or woman who has ever
watched for the birth of a child and planned and
worked to make a place for it in the world. The loss
or crippling of the new-born child jars the character
and morale of the father and mother to the root.
When the object of these ideals dies, something
precious and irreplaceable is taken from the life of the
world. The toll of syphilis in misery, in desolation,
in heart-breakings, in broken bonds and defeated
ideals can never be estimated in numbers or in words.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Course of Hereditary Syphilis in the Infant.</span>&mdash;The
course of syphilis in the child tends to follow certain
general lines. The disease, being contracted before
birth, shows its most active manifestations early in
life. The stillborn child is dead of its disease. The
living child may be born with an eruption, or it may
not develop it for several weeks or months. It is
thought by some that these delayed eruptions represent
infections at birth. Hereditarily syphilitic
children are filled with the spirochetes, the germs of
the disease. They are in every tissue and organ;
the child is literally riddled with them. In spite of
this it may for a time seem well. The typical syphilitic
child, however, is thin, weak, and wasted. Syphilis
hastens old age even in the strong. It turns the
young child into an old man or woman at birth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
The skin is wrinkled, the flesh flabby. The face is
that of an old man&mdash;weazened, pinched, pathetic,
with watery, bleary eyes, and snuffling nose. The
mother often says that all the baby's trouble started
with a bad cold. The disease attacks the throat,
and turns the normal robust cry of a healthy infant
into a feeble squawk. The belly may become enormously
distended from enlargement of the internal
organs, and the rest of the child dwindle to a skeleton.
The eruptions are only a part of the picture
and may be absent, but when they occur, are quite
characteristic, as a rule, especially about the mouth
and buttocks, and do not usually resemble the commoner
skin complaints of infants. It is important
to remember here that a badly nourished, sickly child
with a distressing eczema is not necessarily syphilitic,
and that only a physician is competent to pass an
opinion on the matter. Syphilitic children in a contagious
state are usually too sick to be around much,
so that the risk to the general public is small. On
the other hand, the risk to some woman who tries to
mother or care for some one else's syphilitic child,
if the disease is active, should be thoroughly appreciated.
Women who are not specially trained or
under the direction of a physician should not attempt
the personal care of other people's sick children.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Wet Nurse.</span>&mdash;This is also the proper place to
introduce a warning about the wet nurse. Women
who must have the assistance of a wet nurse to feed
their babies should, under no circumstances, make
such arrangements without the full supervision of
their physicians. There is no better method for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
transmitting syphilis to a healthy woman than for
her to nurse a syphilitic child. Conversely, the
healthy child who is nursed by a syphilitic woman
stands an excellent chance of contracting the disease,
since the woman may have sores about the
nipples and since the germs of syphilis have been
found in the milk of syphilitic women. The only
person who should nurse a syphilitic child is its own
mother, who has syphilis and, therefore, cannot be
infected. A Wassermann blood test with a thorough
examination is the least that should be expected
where any exchanges are to take place. Nothing
whatever should be taken for granted in such cases,
and the necessary examinations and questions should
not give offense to either party to the bargain.
Syphilis is not a respecter of persons, and exists
among the rich as well as among the poor.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Hereditary Syphilis in Older Children.</span>&mdash;Hereditary
syphilis may become a latent or concealed disease,
just as acquired syphilis does. None the less,
it leaves certain traces of its existence which can
be recognized on examination. These are chiefly
changes in the bones, which do not grow normally.
The shin bones are apt to be bowed forward, not
sideways, as in rickets. The skull sometimes develops
a peculiar shape, the joints are apt to be
large, and so on. Syphilis may affect the mental
development of children in various ways. Perhaps
5 per cent of children are idiots as a result of syphilis.
Certain forms of epilepsy are due to syphilitic changes
in the brain. On the other hand, syphilitic children
may be extraordinarily bright and capable for their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
years. Some are stunted in their growth and develop
their sexual characteristics very late or imperfectly.
It is one of the wonders of medicine to
see a sickly runt of a child at fifteen or sixteen develop
in a few months into a very presentable young
man or girl under the influence of salvarsan and
mercury. A few syphilitic children seem robust and
healthy from the start. The signs of the disease
may be very slight, and pass unrecognized even by
the majority of physicians. Some of them may be
splendid specimens of physical and mental development,
but they are exceptional. The majority are
apt to be below par, and nothing shows more plainly
the insidious injury done by the disease than the
way in which they thrive and change under treatment.
Even those who are mentally affected often
show surprising benefits.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Destructive Changes, Bones, Teeth, Etc.</span>&mdash;Syphilis
in children, since it is essentially late syphilis,
may produce gummatous changes of the most disfiguring
type, fully as extreme as those in acquired
syphilis and resulting in the destruction or injury
of important organs, and the loss of parts of bones,
especially about the mouth and nose. Certain
changes in the teeth, especially the upper incisors in
the second set, are frequent in hereditarily syphilitic
children, but do not always occur. These peg-shaped
teeth are called Hutchinson's teeth. Individuals
with hereditary syphilis who survive the
early years of life are less likely to develop trouble
with the heart, blood vessels, or nervous system than
are those with acquired syphilis.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Eye Trouble&mdash;Interstitial Keratitis.</span>&mdash;Two manifestations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
of hereditary syphilis are of obvious social
importance. One of these is the peculiar form of
eye trouble which such children may develop. It
is known as interstitial keratitis, and takes the form
of a gradual, slow clouding of the clear, transparent
convex surface of the eyeball, the cornea, through
which the light passes to reach the lens. While the
process is active, the child is made miserable by an
extreme sensitiveness to light, the eye is reddened,
and there is pain and a burning sensation. When
the condition passes off, the child may scarcely be
able to distinguish light from dark, to say nothing
of reading, finding its way about, or doing fine work.
A certain amount of the damage, once done, cannot
be repaired, although cases improve surprisingly if
the process is still active and is properly treated.
The course is slow, often a matter of years, and only
too many patients do very poorly on the sort of care
they can get at home. One eye case in every 180
has interstitial keratitis, according to reliable figures.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Of 152 with this trouble, only 60 per cent recovered
useful eye-sight and the remaining 40 per cent were
disabled partly or completely. Forty-three out of
71 persons lost more or less of their capacity for
earning a living. In practically all cases it means
the loss of months or years of school between the
ages of five and ten and a permanent handicap in
later life. These patients would belong in school-hospitals,
if such things existed, where they could
get the elaborate treatment that might save their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
eyes, and at the same time not come to a stand-still
mentally. Any chronic inflammatory eye disease
in children urgently needs early medical attention,
and those who know of such cases should do
what they can to secure it for them.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Iglesheimer, quoted by Derby.</p></div>

<p>Blindness in hereditary syphilis may, of course,
take the same form that it does in the acquired disease,
resulting from changes in the nerve of sight
(optic nerve). This form is entirely beyond help by
treatment.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Ear Trouble&mdash;Nerve Deafness.</span>&mdash;The second important
complication of hereditary syphilis is deafness.
This occurs from changes in the nerve of
hearing and may be present at birth or may come on
many years later. The deaf infant is usually recognized
by its failure to learn to talk, although it may
seem perfectly normal in every other way. Again,
the child may hear well at birth and deafness may
come on in later life,&mdash;as late as the twentieth year,&mdash;suddenly
or gradually, and become complete and
permanent. It is often ascribed to colds or to falls
and accidents that happen to occur at the same time.
If syphilitic deafness comes on before the age of ten
years, it is very apt to result in the child's forgetting
how to talk, and becoming dumb as well. It goes
without saying that children whose syphilis made
them deaf at birth never learn to talk at all, and are
therefore deaf and dumb. Very little is known about
how many of the inmates of asylums for the deaf are
hereditary syphilitics, but there is reason to suspect
the percentage to be rather large. Deafness in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
hereditary syphilis is practically uninfluenced by
treatment.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Accident and Injury in Hereditary Syphilis.</span>&mdash;It
is a matter of great importance to realize the large
part played by accidents, injury, poor health, or
lowered resistance in bringing a hidden hereditary
syphilis to the surface. A child may show no special
signs of the disease until some time during its childhood
it has a fall which injures or bruises a bone or
breaks a limb. Then suddenly at the place where
the injury was done a gumma or tertiary syphilitic
change will take place and the bone refuses to heal
or unite or a large sore may develop which may be
operated on before the nature of the condition is
realized. In the same way a woman with hereditary
syphilis may seem in perfect health, marry,
and suddenly after the birth of her first child, even
as late as her twenty-fifth year, may develop syphilitic
eye trouble. It must be realized that hereditary
syphilis is as treacherous as the acquired disease,
and can show as little outward signs before a
serious outbreak. It is part of the duty of every
person who suspects syphilis in his family or who
has it himself to let his physician know of it, for the
sake of the help which it may give in recognizing
obscure conditions in himself or his children.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Marriage and Contagion in Hereditary Syphilis.</span>&mdash;In
general it may be said that, in the matter of
marriage, persons who have hereditary syphilis and
live to adult life with good general health can, after
reasonable treatment, marry without fear of passing
on the disease. Hereditary syphilis apparently is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
not transmitted to the children as acquired syphilis
is. Hereditary syphilis practically is not contagious
except during the eruptions and active manifestations
in infancy, such as the nasal discharge
and the other sores in the mouth and about the genitals.
As adults they can enter into the intimate
relations of life without risk. Many of them, while
perhaps having positive blood tests while the disease
is active, later become negative without treatment.
Some of them even recover from the disease
to the extent that they can acquire it again, since
there is no absolute immunity.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Syphilis in Adopted Children.</span>&mdash;A word might well
be said at this point on the adoption of children with
hereditary syphilis. In all probability this is not a
common occurrence, certain factors tending to diminish
the risk. A child adopted after its second
year will not be so likely to have the disease, since
most syphilitic children die before this age is reached.
Agencies which arrange for the adoption of children
are now much more careful about the matter than
formerly, and a Wassermann test on the mother and
also on the child, as well as a careful history in the
case of the mother, is frequently available. The information
in regard to the mother is quite as important
as that about the child, since the child may
have a negative test while the mother's may be
positive. Children who have hereditary syphilis,
even in latent form, should not be offered for adoption,
and should become a charge upon the state.
Families in which it later develops that an adopted
child was syphilitic should not, however, be needlessly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
alarmed for their own safety, since, from the
standpoint of infectiousness, the late forms of
hereditary syphilis are not dangerous to others. The
agency from which the child was adopted should
assume responsibility for the child if the family
cannot meet the situation. The state of Michigan
has been a pioneer in this country in legislation which
provides for the welfare of these children among
others. A law has been enacted making it possible
to provide for their medical treatment for an indefinite
period in the state hospital at Ann Arbor,
at the cost of the state.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Treatment of Hereditary Syphilis.</span>&mdash;The question
of the treatment and cure of a person with hereditary
syphilis is in many respects a different one from
that in an acquired case. The foothold which the
germ has in the body in hereditary syphilis is stronger
even than in an untreated acquired case. Many of
the changes produced by it are permanent, and the
prospects of completely eradicating it are correspondingly
small. On the other hand, the child who
survives hereditary syphilis has probably an enormous
resistance to the disease, which in a measure
compensates for the hold which it has on him.
Treatment in hereditary syphilis becomes an extremely
difficult problem because it must in many
cases be carried out during infancy, and for that
reason the co&ouml;peration of the patient cannot be secured.
By treating the mother, we now know that
we can accomplish a great deal for the unborn child.
Once the child is born, its salvation will depend on
unremitting care and labor. If it is skilfully treated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
and kept at the breast, it is estimated that it has
even as high as ninety chances in one hundred of
surviving to a useful life. Salvarsan can be given
to even very small babies, and mercury also is employed
with excellent results. Persistence and skill
are essential, and for that reason, if possible, hereditary
syphilis in active form in later childhood should
have the advantage of occasional or prolonged treatment
in special hospitals or sanitariums where the
child could go to school while he is being built up and
cared for. This is not like trying to salvage wreckage.
Many syphilitic children are brilliant, and if
treated before they are crippled by the disease, give
every sign of capacity and great usefulness to the
world. Welander, who was one of the greatest of
European experts on syphilis, has left himself an
enduring monument in the form of the so-called
Welander homes, which have been established by
cities like Copenhagen, Berlin, and Vienna to provide
for such children the combined benefits of the
school and the hospital. We cannot be too prompt
in adopting similar provision for such cases in this
country. There can be little excuse, eugenic or
otherwise, for not doing the utmost that modern
medical science is capable of for their benefit.</p>

<h3>The Transmission and Hygiene of Syphilis</h3>

<p>The problem of the control of syphilis as a contagious
disease is the least appreciated and the most
important one in the whole field. It should be the
key to our whole attitude toward the disease, and
once given its rightful place in our minds, will revolutionize
our situation with regard to it. For that
reason, while some repetition of what has gone before
may be unavoidable, it will be worth while to gather
in one chapter the details relating to the question of
how the disease is spread about.</p>

<p>Two bed-rock facts stand out as the basis for the
whole discussion. First, for practical purposes syphilis
is contagious only in the primary and secondary
stages. Second, syphilis is transmitted only by open
sores or lesions whose discharges contain the germs,
or by objects which are contaminated by those discharges.
Infection with syphilis by such fluids as
the blood, milk, or spermatic fluid uncontaminated
by contact with active lesions is at least unusual.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Contagiousness in the Primary Stage.</span>&mdash;The chancre
is always contagious. If it is covered with a dry
crust, it is, of course, less so, but as soon as the crust
is rubbed off, the germ-infested surface is exposed
and the thin, watery discharge contains immense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
numbers of the organisms, especially in the first two
or three weeks. This is just as true of a chancre
on the lip or chin as on the genitals. Chancres
which are in moist places, as in the mouth, or on the
neck of the womb, or under the foreskin, are especially
dangerous, because the moisture keeps the
germs on the surface.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Contagiousness in the Secondary Stage.</span>&mdash;In the
secondary period, when the body is simply filled with
germs, one would expect the risk to be even greater
than in the primary stage. As a matter of fact,
however, no matter how many germs there are in
the body, the only ones that are dangerous to others
are those that are able to get to the surface. A
syphilitic nodule or hard pimple on the hand or face
is not contagious so long as the skin is dry and unbroken
over it. The sores which occur in the moist,
warm, protected places, like the mouth, on the lips,
about the genitals, and in the folds of the body, such
as the thighs, groins, armpits, and under the breasts
in women, are, like the chancre, the real sources of
danger in the spread of the disease.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Relatively Non-contagious Character of Late Syphilis.</span>&mdash;The
older a syphilis is, the less dangerous it
becomes. It is the fresh infection and the early
years which are a menace to others. It will be recalled
that the germs die out in the body in immense
numbers after the active secondary period is over, so
that when the tertiary stage is reached, there is only
a handful left, so to speak. The germs in a tertiary
sore are so few in number that for practical purposes
it is safe to say they may be disregarded, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
for that reason late syphilis is practically harmless
for others. Just as every syphilitic runs a gradual
course to a tertiary period, so every syphilitic in
time becomes non-contagious, almost regardless of
treatment.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Time Element in Contagiousness.</span>&mdash;It is the
time that it takes an untreated case to reach a non-infectious
stage and the events or conditions which
can occur in the interval, that perpetuate syphilis
among us. The chancre is contagious for several
weeks, and few syphilitics escape having some contagious
secondary lesions the first year. These are
often inconspicuous and misunderstood. They may be
mistaken for cold sores or the lesions about the opening
of the rectum may be mistaken for hemorrhoids,
or piles. The recurrence of these same kinds of
sores may make the patient dangerous from time to
time to those about him, without his knowledge.
It is an unfortunate thing that the most contagious
lesions of syphilis often give the patient least warning
of their presence in the form of pain or discomfort.
While they can often be recognized on sight
by a physician, it is sometimes necessary to examine
them with a dark-field microscope to prove their
character by finding the germs. It is a safer rule to
regard every open sore or suspicious patch in a
syphilitic as infectious until it is proved not to be so.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Contagious Recurrences or Relapses.</span>&mdash;The duration
of the infectious period in untreated cases and
the proportion of infectious lesions in a given case
vary a good deal and both may be matters of the
utmost importance. Some persons with syphilis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
may have almost no recognizable lesions after the
chancre has disappeared. Others under the same
conditions may have crop after crop of them. There
is a kind of case in which recurrences are especially
common on the mucous or moist surfaces of the
mouth and throat, and such patients may hardly be
free from them or from warty and moist growths
about the genitals during the first five years of the
disease, unless they are continuously and thoroughly
treated. Irritation about the genitals and the use
of tobacco in the mouth encourage the appearance
of contagious patches. Smokers, chewers, persons
with foul mouths and bad teeth, and prostitutes
are especially dangerous for these reasons.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Average Contagious Period.</span>&mdash;It is a safe general
rule, the product of long experience, to consider a
person with an untreated<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> syphilis as decidedly infectious
for the first three years of his disease, and
somewhat so the next two years. The duration of
infectiousness may be longer, although it is not the
rule. It must be said, however, that more exact
study of this matter since the germ of syphilis was
discovered has tended to show that the contagious
period is apt to be longer than was at first supposed,
and has taught us the importance of hidden sores
in such places as the throat and vagina.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="caption">Individual Resistance to Infection.</span>&mdash;The contagiousness
of untreated syphilis is influenced by
two other factors besides the mere lapse of time.
The first of these is the resistance or opposition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
offered to the germ by the person to whom the infection
is carried. The second is the feebleness of
the germ itself, and the ease with which it dies when
removed from the body. In regard to the first of
these factors, while natural resistance to the disease
in uninfected persons is an uncertain quantity, it is
very probable that it exists. It is certain that the
absence of any break in the skin on which the germs
are deposited makes a decided difference if it does
not entirely remove the risk of infection. A favorable
place for the germ to get a foothold is a matter
of the greatest importance. When, however, it is
remembered that such a break may exist and not be
visible, it is evident that little reliance should be
placed on this factor in estimating the risk or possibility
of infection.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Transmission by Infected Articles.</span>&mdash;The feebleness
of the germ and the ease with which it is destroyed
are its redeeming qualities. This is of special
importance in considering transmission by contact
with infected articles. Nothing which is absolutely
dry will transmit syphilis. Moisture is necessary to
infection with it, and only articles which have been
moistened, such as dressings containing the discharges,
and objects, such as cups, eating utensils,
pipes, common towels, and instruments which come
in contact with open sores or their discharges, are
likely to be dangerous. Moreover, even though
these objects remain moist, the spirochetes are likely
to die out within six or seven hours, and may lose
their infectiousness before this. Smooth, non-absorbent
surfaces, especially of metal, are unfavorable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
for the germ. Wash-basins, dishes, silverware, and
toilet articles are usually satisfactorily disinfected by
hot soapsuds, followed by drying. Barbers, dentists,
nurses, and physicians who take care at least to disinfect
instruments and other objects brought into
contact with patients with carbolic acid and alcohol
will never transmit syphilitic infection to others.
Toilet-seats, bath-tubs, and door-knobs, although
theoretically dangerous, are practically never so,
and syphilitic infection transmitted by them can be
dismissed as all but unknown. This is in marked
contrast to gonorrhea, which in the case of little
girls can be transmitted apparently by toilet-seats.
Much depends, as has been said, on placing the germ
on a favorable ground for inoculation, and the bare
skin, unless the virus is massaged or rubbed in, is
certainly not a favorable situation. Many experts
do not hesitate to handle infectious lesions with the
fingers provided the skin is not broken, relying simply
on the immediate use of soap and water, and perhaps
alcohol, to remove the germ. While this may be a
risk, it should, none the less, reassure those who are
inclined to an unreasoning terror of infection whenever
they encounter the disease.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Transmission Under the Conditions of Every-day
Life.</span>&mdash;The question of just how dangerous the worker
with foodstuffs may be to others when he has active
contagious lesions is unsettled. Recent surveys of
various types of workers have tended to show that
syphilis in transmissible form is not especially prevalent
among them. The same general principle
applies here as elsewhere. The risk of infection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
with syphilis increases with dirty and unsanitary
conditions, and becomes serious when there is opportunity
for moist materials to be transferred to sensitive
surfaces, like the mouth, sufficiently soon after
they have left the syphilitic person for the germs to
be still alive. That the real extent of the risk is not
known does not make it any the less important that
persons who have opportunity to handle materials
in which this may occur should be subject to frequent
sanitary inspection. Restaurants in which the silverware
is not properly cleaned, and is used over and
over at frequent intervals, and in which there is a
careless and unsanitary type of personal service, can
hardly be regarded as safe. While there is no need
for hysterical alarm over such possibilities, it is just
as well to provide for them. Crowding, close quarters,
and insufficient sanitary conveniences in stores
and offices, in restaurants or tenements, provide
just the conditions in which accidental infection may
occur. A gang of men with a common bucket and
drinking cup may be at the mercy of syphilis if one
member is in a contagious condition. A syphilitic
might cough into the air with little risk, since the
germs would die before they could find a favorable
place to infect. But a syphilitic who coughs directly
into one's face with a mouth full of spirochetes multiplies
the risk considerably. The public towel is
certainly dangerous&mdash;almost as much so as the common
drinking cup. The possibility of syphilitic infection
by cutting the knuckle of the hand against
the teeth of an opponent in striking a blow upon his
mouth should not be overlooked, and the occurrence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
is common enough for this type of chancre to have
received the special name of brawl, or fist, chancre.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Accidental Syphilis in Physicians and Nurses.</span>&mdash;Another
type of infection ought not to go unmentioned&mdash;that
to which physicians and nurses are exposed
in operating on or handling patients with
active syphilis. Before the day of rubber gloves
such things were much more common perhaps than
they are now, yet they are common enough at the
present time. Most of the risk occurs in exploring
or working in cavities of the body containing infected
discharges. The blood may become infected in
passing over active sores. The risk from all these
sources is so considerable that it is justifiable as a
measure of protection to a hospital staff to take a
blood test on every patient who applies for treatment
in a hospital, to say nothing of the advantage which
this would be to the patient.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Transmission by Intimate Contacts&mdash;Kissing.</span>&mdash;As
we pass from the less to the more intimate means
of contact between the syphilitic person and others,
the risk of transmitting syphilis may be said to increase
enormously. The fundamental conditions of
moisture, a susceptible surface, protection of the
germ from drying and from air, and possibly also
massage or rubbing, are here better satisfied than in
the risks thus far considered. Kissing, caresses, and
sexual relations make up the origin of an overwhelming
proportion of syphilitic infection. Infections are,
of course, traceable to the nursing of syphilitic infants.
It is through these sources of contact that
syphilis invades the family especially. Many a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
syphilitic who realizes that he should not have sexual
relations with his wife while he has the disease in
active form will thoughtlessly infect her or his children
by kissing. Kissing games are potentially
dangerous, and a classical example of this danger is
that of a reported case<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> in which a young man in
Philadelphia infected seven young girls in one game,
all of whom developed chancres on the lips or cheeks.
It is no great rarity to find a syphilis dating from
a sore on the lip that developed while a young couple
were engaged. Certainly the indiscriminate kissing
of strangers is as dangerous an indulgence as can be
imagined. Syphilis does not by any means invariably
follow a syphilitic's kiss, but the risk, although
not computable in figures, is large enough to make
even the impulsive pause. The combination of a
cold sore or a small crack on the lip of the one and a
mucous patch inside the lip of the other brings disaster
very near. Children are sometimes the unhappy
victims of this sort of thing, and it should be
resented as an insult for a stranger to attempt to
kiss another's child, no matter on what part of the
body. It would be easy to multiply instances of
the ways in which syphilis may be spread by the
careless or ignorant in the close associations of family
life, but little would be accomplished by such
elaboration that would not occur to one who took the
trouble to acquaint himself with the principles already
discussed.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Sexual Transmission of Syphilis.</span>&mdash;The sexual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
transmission of syphilis is beyond question the most
important factor in the spread of the disease. Here
all the essential conditions for giving the germ a foothold
on the body are satisfied. The genitals are
especially fitted to keep the germs in an active condition
because of the ease with which air is excluded
from the numerous folds about these parts. It is
remarkable what trifling lesions can harbor them by
the million, and how completely, especially in the
case of women, syphilitic persons may be ignorant
of the danger for others. Sexual transmission of
syphilis is simply a physiologic fact, and in no sense
to be confounded with questions of innocence and
guilt in relation to the acquiring of the disease. A
chancre acquired from a drinking cup or pipe may be
transmitted to husband or wife through a mucous
patch on the genitals and to children through an
infected mother, without the question of innocence
or guilt ever having arisen. On the other hand,
chancres on parts other than the genitals may be
<i>acquired in any but innocent ways</i>. It is impossible
to be fair or to think clearly so long as we allow the
question of innocence or guilt to color our thought
about the genital transmission of syphilis. That
syphilis is so largely a sexually transmitted disease
is an incidental rather than the essential fact from
the broadly social point of view. We should recognize
it only to the extent that is necessary to give us
control over it&mdash;not allow it to hold us helplessly in
its grip because we cannot separate it from the idea
of sexual indiscretion. There is a form of narrow-minded
self-righteousness about these things that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
sets the stamp of vice on innocent and guilty alike
simply on the strength of the sexual transmission of
syphilis. In the effort to avoid so mistaken and
heartless a view, we cannot remind ourselves too
often that syphilis is a disease and not a crime, and
as such must be approached with the impulse to
heal and make whole, and not to heap further misfortune
on its victim or take vengeance on him.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Extragenital and Marital Syphilis.</span>&mdash;Estimates of
the ratio of genital to non-genital or so-called extra-genital
infection in syphilis vary a good deal, and are
largely the products of the clinical period in the history
of the disease before the days of more exact
methods of detecting its presence. The older statistics
estimate from 5 to 10 per cent of all syphilitic
infections to be of non-genital origin, while the remaining
90 per cent are genital. As we become better
able to recognize hidden syphilis, we shall probably
find that the percentage of non-genital infections will
increase.</p>

<p>The physician's suspicions are easily aroused by a
genital sore, less so by one on the lip or the tonsil, for
example. The same thing is true of the layman.
Syphilis which starts from a chancre elsewhere than
on the genitals runs the same course and may conceal
itself quite as effectively as syphilis from the
usual sources, and for that reason may even more
easily escape notice because misinterpreted at the
start. It is my personal impression that careful
study of patients with syphilis, and of those who live
with them, would bring to light many overlooked
extragenital infections, especially among those who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
are the victims of crowding, poor living conditions,
and ignorance. Estimates on the amount of syphilis
which is contracted in marriage are apt to be
largely guesswork in the absence of reliable vital
statistics on the disease. Fournier believed that 20
per cent of syphilis in women was contracted in
marriage. So much syphilis in married women is
unsuspected, and so little of what is recognized is
traceable to outside sources, that 50 per cent seems
a nearer estimate than twenty.</p>

<h3>The Transmission and Hygiene of Syphilis
(Continued)</h3>

<h4 class="smcap">The Control of Infectiousness in Syphilis.&mdash;Syphilis
and Marriage</h4>


<p><span class="caption">Means for Controlling Infectiousness.</span>&mdash;The usual
method of controlling a very contagious disease, such
as scarlet fever or measles, is to put the patient off
by himself with those who have to care for him and
to keep others away&mdash;that is, to quarantine them.
This works very well for diseases which run a reasonably
short course, and in which contagious periods
are not apt to recur after the patient has been released.
But in diseases such as tuberculosis and
syphilis, in which contagiousness may extend over
months and years, such a procedure is evidently out
of the question. We cannot deprive a patient of his
power to earn a living, to say nothing of his liberty,
without providing for his support and for that of
those who are dependent on him. To do this in so
common a disease as syphilis would involve an expenditure
of money and an amount of machinery
that is unthinkable. Accordingly, as a practical
scheme for preventing its spread, the quarantine of
syphilis throughout the infectious period is out of the
question. We must, therefore, consider the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
two means available for diminishing the risk to others.
The first of these, and the most important, is to
treat the disease efficiently right from the start, so
that contagious sores and patches will be as few in
number as possible, and will recur as little as possible
in the course of the disease. This will be in effect
a shortening of the contagious period, and should be
recognized as one of the great aims of treatment.
The second means will be to teach the syphilitic and
the general public those things which one who has
the disease can do to make himself as harmless as
possible to others. This demands the education of
the patient if we hope for his co&ouml;peration, and demands
also the co&ouml;peration of those around him in
order that the pressure of public sentiment may
oblige him to do his part in case he does not do it of
his own free will.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Control of Infectiousness by Treatment&mdash;Importance
of Salvarsan.</span>&mdash;In a disease which yields so exceptionally
well to treatment as syphilis, a great
deal can be done to shorten the contagious period.
Especially is this so when we are able to employ an
agent such as salvarsan, which kills off the germs on
the surface within twenty-four hours after its injection.
When a patient is discovered to be in a contagious
state, in a large majority of cases the risk to the community
which he represents can be quickly eliminated,
at least for the time being. Combining the
use of mercury and salvarsan in accordance with
the best modern standards, the actively contagious
period as a whole can be reduced in average cases
from a matter of years to one of a few weeks or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
months. Certainly, so far as recognizable dangerous
sores are concerned, periodic examination, with salvarsan
whenever necessary, would seem to dispose
of much of the difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Obstacles to Control by Treatment.</span>&mdash;There are,
however, obstacles in the way of complete control
of infectiousness by treatment. For example, one
might ask whether a single negative blood test would
not be sufficient assurance that the patient was free
from contagious sores. It is, however, a well-recognized
fact that a person with syphilis may develop
infectious sores about the mouth and the genitals
even while the blood test is negative. An examination,
moreover, is not invariably sufficient to determine
if a patient is in a contagious state. The
value of an examination depends, of course, entirely
on its thoroughness and on the experience of the
physician who makes it. It is only too easy to overlook
one of the faint grayish patches in the mouth
or a trifling pimple on the genitals. The time and
special apparatus for a microscopic examination are
not always available. Moreover, contagious lesions
come and go. One may appear on the genitals one
day and a few days later be gone, without the patient's
ever realizing that it was there&mdash;yet in this
interval a married man might infect his wife by
sexual contact. The patient with a concealed
syphilis often lacks even the incentive to seek examination
by a doctor. It is important also to
realize that when mercury has to be the only reliance,
the risk of infection cannot be entirely controlled by
treatment. Contagious sores may develop even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
during a course of mercurial injections, especially in
early cases. It requires the combination of mercury
and salvarsan to secure the highest percentage of
good results.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Five-year Rule.</span>&mdash;The truth of the matter is
that, as Hoffmann says, no treatment can <i>guarantee</i>
the non-infectiousness of a syphilitic in the first five
years of his disease. Time is thus an essential element
in pronouncing a person non-infectious and
hence in deciding his fitness for marriage, for example.
The person with active syphilis who has
intimate relations with uninfected persons, who will
not abandon smoking or take special precautions
about articles of personal use which are likely to
transmit the disease, is unsafe no matter what is
done for him. In spite of this qualifying statement
it may be reiterated, however, that good treatment
with salvarsan and mercury reduces the risk of infecting
others in the ordinary relations of life practically
to the vanishing point, and of course reduces,
but not entirely eliminates, the dangers of the intimate
contacts.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Personal Responsibility of the Patient.</span>&mdash;If we are
compelled then to fall back to some extent upon the
personal sense of responsibility of the patient himself
to fill in the gap where treatment does not entirely
control the situation, it becomes increasingly
important that in the irresponsible and ignorant,
when the patient fails to meet his obligation, we
should push treatment to the uttermost in our effort
to prevent the spread of the disease. To supply
this necessary treatment to every syphilitic who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
cannot afford it for himself, and make it obligatory,
if need be, will be a long step forward in the control
of the disease. The educational campaign for it is
well under way all over the world, and the money
and the practical machinery will inevitably follow.
We have the precedents of the control of tuberculosis,
smallpox, malaria, and yellow fever to guide us,
to say nothing of a practical system against sexual
disease already in operation in Norway, Sweden,
Denmark, and Italy.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Syphilis and Marriage.</span>&mdash;The problem of the relation
of syphilis to marriage is simply an aspect of
the transmission of an infectious disease. The infection
of one party to the marriage by the other and
the transmission of that infection to children summarizes
the social problem. Through the intimate
contacts of family life, syphilis attacks the future of
the human race.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Estimated Risk of Infecting the Wife.</span>&mdash;How serious
is the risk of infecting the wife if a man should
marry during the contagious period of syphilis?
This will depend a good deal on the frequency of
relapses after the active secondary stage. On this
point Sperk estimated that in 1518 patients, only
ten escaped relapses entirely. These were, however,
not patients that had been specially well treated.
Keyes, quoted by Pusey, estimated, on the basis of
his private records, that the chances taken by a
syphilitic husband who used no special precautions
to prevent infecting his wife were twelve to one the
first year in favor of infection, five to two the second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
year, and one to four the third year, being negligible
after the fourth year.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Syphilis in the Father.</span>&mdash;Even while we recognize
the infection of women and children as the greatest
risk in marriage we should not lose sight of the cost
to society which syphilis in the father of the family
himself may entail. For such a man to be stricken
by some of the serious accidents of late syphilis
throws his family as well as himself upon society.
A syphilitic infection which has not been cured not
only makes a man a poor risk to an insurance company,
but a poor risk to the family which has to look
to him for support and for his share and influence in
the bringing up of the children. A sufficient number
of men and women in the thirties and forties are
crippled, made dependent, or lost to the world entirely,
to make the responsibilities of the family
when assumed by persons with untreated or poorly
treated syphilis a matter of some concern, whether
or not they are still able to transmit the disease to
others.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Time-treatment Principle and the Five-year
Rule.</span>&mdash;In setting a modern standard for the fitness
of syphilitics for marriage it may be said at the outset
that there is little justification for making the
mere fact of a previous syphilitic infection a permanent
bar in the majority of cases. The risk of economic
disaster to the parent and wage-earner, and
the risk of transmission of the disease to the partner
and the children, are both controllable by a combination
of efficient treatment and time. The man who
has conformed to the best practice in both particulars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
may usually marry and have healthy children.
The woman under the same circumstances need not
fear that the risk of having offspring injured by her
disease is any greater than the risk that they will be
injured by any other of the unforeseen risks that surround
the bringing of a child into the world. A vast
experience underlies what might be called the time-treatment
principle on which permission to marry
after syphilis should be based. It has recently been
ably summarized again, and with commendable conservatism,
by Hoffmann in the rule that a syphilitic
who has been efficiently treated by modern standards,
with mercury and salvarsan, over a period of two to
three years, and who has remained free from all
symptoms and signs of the disease for two years
after all treatment was stopped, including negative
blood and spinal fluid tests, may marry in from
four to five years from the beginning of his infection.
Variations of this rule must be allowed only with
great conservatism, since salvarsan, on whose efficiency
many pleas for a shortening of probation have
been based, is still too recent an addition to our
implements of warfare to justify a rash dependence
upon it. The abortive cure in relation to marriage
is a problem in itself, and the shortening of time
allowed in such cases must be individually determined
by an expert who has had the case in charge
from the beginning, and not, at least as yet, by the
average doctor. Such a standard as this for the
marriage of persons who have had syphilis steers
essentially a middle course between those who condemn
syphilitics to an unreasonable and needless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
deprivation of all the joys of family life, and those
who are too ready to take our conquest of syphilis
for granted and to cast to the winds centuries of
experience with the treachery of the disease.</p>

<p>Even while we concede the value of generations of
experience with syphilis in determining the probable
risk of infection, it is a duty to investigate thoroughly
by the modern methods, such as the Wassermann
blood test, the condition of all members of a family
in which syphilis has appeared. This means, for
example, that even though the husband with syphilis
may have married years after the usual period
of infectiousness has passed, his wife, though outwardly
healthy, should have a Wassermann test,
and his children would be none the worse for an
examination, even though they seem normal. Syphilis
is an insidious disease, a consummate master of
deceit, able to strike from what seems a clear sky.
The latest means for its recognition have already
revolutionized some of our conceptions of its dangers
and its transmission. It is only common prudence
to take advantage of them in every case, to forestall
even the remotest possibility of mistake or oversight.</p>

<p>Where both husband and wife have had syphilis,
even though both are past the infectious stage, both
should be treated, and a complete cure for the wife
is advisable before they undertake to have children.
This must mean an added burden of responsibility
on both physician and patient, and one extremely
difficult to meet under existing conditions. A reliable
means of birth control used in such cases would
place the problem in women on a par with that in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
men, and give the physician's insistence on a complete
cure for the woman a reasonable prospect of
being needed. Where his advice is disregarded and
a pregnancy results, the woman should be efficiently
treated while she is carrying the child.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Syphilis and Engagements to Marry.</span>&mdash;If a five-year
rule is to be applied to marriage, a similar rule
should cover the engagement of a syphilitic to marry,
and it should cover the sexual relations of married
people who acquire syphilis. It is not too much to
expect that an engaged person who contracts syphilis
shall break his engagement, and not renew it or contract
another until by the five-year rule he would be
able to marry with safety.</p>

<p>Engagements nowadays may well be thought of
as equivalent to marriage when the question of
syphilis is considered. They not infrequently offer
innumerable opportunities for intimacies which may
or may not fall short of actual sexual relations.
Attention has been called to this situation by social
workers among wage-earning girls. It has been a
distressingly frequent experience in my special practice
to find that the young man, overwrought by the
excitement of wooing, has exposed himself elsewhere
to infection and unwittingly punished the trustfulness
of his fianc&eacute;e by infecting her with syphilis
through a subsequent kiss. The publication of
banns before marriage is worth while, and unmistakable
testimony as to the character and health of the
parties concerned might well be exchanged before a
wooing is permitted to assume the character of an
engagement. It is of little use to say that a Wassermann<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
and a medical examination should be made
before marriage, when the damage may be done long
before that point is reached.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Medical Examination for Syphilis before Marriage.</span>&mdash;How
shall we recognize syphilis in a candidate
for marriage? The prevailing idea is to demand
a negative Wassermann test. Assuredly this
is good as far as it goes, but it is not so reliable as to
deserve incorporation into law as sole sufficient evidence
of the absence of syphilis, as has been done in
one state. From what has been said, it is plain that
a single negative Wassermann is no proof of the absence
of syphilis. The subject must be approached
from other angles, and when syphilis may be suspected,
the question should be decided <i>by an expert</i>.
A thorough general or physical examination is desirable,
and if this reveals suspicious signs, such as
scars, enlarged glands, etc., it is then possible to
investigate the Wassermann report more thoroughly
by repeating the test, sending it to another expert
for confirmation. In some cases it may even be
necessary to insist that the patient submit to a
special test, called the provocative test, in which a
small injection of salvarsan is used to bring out a
positive blood test if there is a concealed syphilis.
These are, of course, measures which are seldom
necessary except in patients who have had the disease.
Much depends on the attitude of the patient
toward the examination and his willingness to co&ouml;perate.
A resourceful physician can usually settle
the question of a person's fitness for marriage, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the result of a reliable examination offers a reasonable
assurance of safety.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Laws Crippling Physicians in Such Matters.</span>&mdash;What
shall the physician do when confronted with
positive evidence that a patient who is about to
marry has an active syphilis? It is important for
laymen to understand that the law relating to professional
confidence between physician and patient
ties the hands of the physician in such a situation.
For the doctor to tell the relatives of the healthy
party to such an intended marriage that the other
has active syphilis would make him subject to severe
penalties in many states for a violation of professional
confidence, or to suit for libel. Of course, if
the patient has agreed to submit to examination to
determine his fitness for marriage, the physician's
path is clear, but if the condition is discovered in
ordinary professional relations, there is nothing to be
done except to try to persuade the patient not to
marry&mdash;advice he usually rejects. To this blind
policy of protecting the guilty at the expense of the
innocent an immeasurable amount of human efficiency
and happiness has been sacrificed. Fortunately
there are signs of an awakening. For example,
Ohio has recently amended the law so as to
permit a physician to disclose to the parties concerned
that a person about to be married has a
venereal disease (Amendment to Section 1275,
General Code, page 177). This is preventive legislation,
as distinguished from the old policy of locking
the stable door after the horse was stolen by laws
punishing one who infects another with a venereal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
disease after marriage has been contracted. Recent
Supreme Court decisions (Wisconsin) have
also taken the ground that a venereal disease existing
at the time of marriage and concealed from the
other party is ground for annulment of the marriage,
provided the uninfected party ceases to have marital
relations as soon as the fact is discovered.</p>

<p>The problem of syphilis in its relation to marriage
is, of course, a serious one. It is safe to say that it
will never be completely met except by a vigorous
general public program against syphilis as a sanitary
problem. It is by no means so serious, however, that
it need lead clean young men and women to remain
single for fear they will encounter it. The medical
examination of both parties before marriage, efficiently
carried out by disinterested experts, each perhaps
of the other's appointing, is the best insurance
a man and woman can secure at the present day
against the risk that syphilis will mar their happiness.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<h3>The Transmission and Hygiene of Syphilis
(Continued)</h3>

<h4 class="smcap">Syphilis and Prostitution</h4>

<p>In taking up the consideration of the relation of
syphilis to illicit sexual relations, we must again remind
ourselves that we are approaching this subject,
not as moralists, important though their point of
view may be, but for the time being as sanitarians,
considering it from the standpoint of a method of
transmission of a contagious disease.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Genital and Non-genital Syphilis in Lax Individuals.</span>&mdash;The
prevalence of syphilis among women who
receive promiscuous attentions is enormous. It is
practically an axiom that no woman who is lax in
her relations with men is safe from the danger of the
disease, or can long remain free from it. The type
of man who is a Light o' Love does not go far before
he meets the partner who has been infected by some
one else. Becoming infected himself, he passes on his
infection to his next partner. Syphilis is not so
often transmitted in prostitution, open or secret,
as gonorrhea, but it is sufficiently so to make the
odds overwhelmingly against even the knowing
ones who hope to indulge and yet escape. The
acquiring of syphilis from loose men or women is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
usually thought of as entirely an affair of genital
contacts. Yet it is notable that extra-genital chancres
are the not uncommon result of liberties taken
with light women which do not go to the extent of
sexual relation. Women who accept intimacies of
men who, while unwilling to commit an outright
breach of decency, will take liberties with a woman
who will accept them have only themselves to blame
if it suddenly develops that the infection has been
transmitted from one to the other by kisses or other
supposedly mild offenses against the proprieties.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Syphilis Among Prostitutes.</span>&mdash;As to the prevalence
of syphilis among both public and clandestine or
secret prostitutes, several notable surveys of more or
less typical conditions have been made. With the
aid of the Wassermann test much heretofore undiscovered
syphilis has been revealed. Eighty to 85
per cent of prostitutes at some time in their careers
acquire the disease.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> About half this number are
likely to have active evidence of the disease. Thirty
per cent of the prostitutes investigated by Papee in
Lemberg were in the most dangerous period&mdash;the
first to the third year of the disease. Three-fourths
of these dangerous cases were in women under
twenty-five years of age&mdash;in the most attractive
period of their lives. Averaging a number of large
European cities, it was found that not more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
40 per cent of prostitutes were even free of the outward
signs of syphilis, to say nothing of what laboratory
tests might have revealed. It is more than
evident that prostitution is admirably fitted to play
the leading r&ocirc;le in the dissemination of this disease.
The young and attractive prostitute, whether in a
house of ill-fame, on the street, or in the more secret
and private highways and by-ways of illicit sexual
life, is the one who attracts the largest number with
the most certain prospect of infecting them.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a>
The figures here given are based on those of Papee, Wwednesky,
Raff, Sederholm, and others. The recently published investigations of
the Baltimore Vice Commission showed that 63.7 per cent of 289 prostitutes
examined by the Wassermann test had syphilis. Of 266 examined
for gonorrhea, 92.1 per cent showed its presence. Nearly half the
girls examined had both diseases and only 3.39 per cent had neither.
(Survey, March 25, 1916, Vol. 35, p. 749.)</p></div>

<p><span class="caption">Concealed Syphilis and Medical Examinations of
Prostitutes.</span>&mdash;A number of delusions center around
the relation of open and secret prostitution to disease.
From the description of syphilis given in the
foregoing pages, it must be apparent how little
reliance can be placed, for example, on the ordinary
medical examination of prostitutes as practised
in segregated districts. The difficulties of efficient
examination are enormous, especially in women.
Even with the best facilities and a high degree of
personal skill, with plenty of time and laboratory
help in addition, extremely contagious syphilis can
escape observation entirely, and even the negative
result of one day's examination may be reversed by
the appearance of a contagious sore on the next.
Women can transmit syphilis passively by the
presence of infected secretions in the genital canal
even when they themselves are not in a contagious
state. In the same way a woman may find herself
infected by a man without any idea that he was in an
infectious state. She may in turn develop active
syphilis without ever realizing the fact. Medical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
examination of prostitutes as ordinarily carried out
does actual harm by deluding both the women and
their partners into a false sense of security. The
life which such women lead, with the combination of
local irritation, disease, and fast living, makes them
especially likely to develop the contagious mucous
patches, warts, and other recurrences, and to relapse
so often that there can be little assurance that they
are not contagious all the time.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances one might almost expect
every contact with a prostitute on the part of
a non-syphilitic individual to result in a new infection.
The factors which interfere to prevent such
wholesale disaster are the same which govern infectiousness
throughout the disease. Local conditions
may be unfavorable, even though the germs are
present, or there may be no break in the skin for the
germs to enter. If the syphilitic individual is beyond
the infectious period, there may be no dangerous
lesions. Here, as all through the history of infections
with syphilis, there is an element of the unexpected,
a favoring combination of circumstances.
Sometimes when infection is most to be expected it
is escaped, and conversely it seems at times that in
the "sure thing," the "safe chance," and the place
where infection seems most improbable, it is most
certain to occur.</p>

<h4 class="smcap">Personal Hygiene in Syphilis</h4>

<p>Syphilis is a constitutional disease, affecting in
one way or another the whole body. For that
reason, measures directed to improving the general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
health and maintaining the resistance of the patient
at the highest point have an important place in the
management of the disease. By his habits and mode
of life a person with syphilis does much to help or
hinder his cure, and to protect or endanger those
around him. For that reason a statement of general
principles may well be drawn up to indicate what is
desirable in these regards.</p>

<p><span class="caption">A Well-balanced Life.</span>&mdash;First, for his own sake,
a syphilitic should live a well-balanced and simple
life so far as possible. In this disease the organs and
structures of the body which are subject to greatest
strain are the ones most likely to suffer the serious
effects of the disease. Worry and anxiety, excessive
mental work, long hours without proper rest, strain
the nervous system and predispose it to attack.
Excessive physical work, fatigue, exhaustion, poor
food, bad air, exposure, injure the bodily resistance.
Excesses of any kind are as injurious as deprivation.
In fact, it is the dissipated, the high livers, who go
to the ground with the disease even quicker than
those who have to pinch.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Alcohol.</span>&mdash;Alcohol in any form, in particular, has
been shown by extensive experience, especially since
the study of the nervous system in syphilis has been
carried to a fine point, to have an especially dangerous
effect on the syphilitic. Alcohol damages not
only the nervous system, but also the blood vessels,
and makes an unrivaled combination in favor of
early syphilitic apoplexy, general paresis, and locomotor
ataxia. A syphilitic who drinks at all is a
bad risk, busily engaged in throwing away his chances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
of cure. Even mild alcoholic beverages are undesirable
and the patient should lose no time in dropping
them entirely.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Tobacco.</span>&mdash;Tobacco has a special place reserved
for it as an unfavorable influence on the course of
syphilis. It is dangerous to others for a syphilitic
to smoke or chew because, more than any other one
thing, it causes the recurrence of contagious patches
in the mouth. It is remarkable how selfish many
syphilitic men are on this point. In spite of the most
positive representations, they will keep on smoking.
Not a few of them pay for their selfishness with
their lives. These mucous patches in the mouth,
often called "smoker's patches," predispose the person
who develops them to one of the most dangerous
forms of cancer, which is especially likely to
develop on tissues, like those of the mouth and tongue,
which have been the seat of these sores.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Sexual Relations, Kissing, Etc.</span>&mdash;Contagious
Sores.&mdash;Sexual indulgence, kissing, and other intimate
contacts during the active stage of syphilis,
as has been indicated, directly expose others to the
risk of getting the disease. For that reason they
should not be indulged in during the first two years
of the average well-treated case receiving salvarsan
and mercury by the most modern methods. Exceptions
to this rule should be granted only by the
physician, and should be preceded by careful and repeated
examination in connection with the treatment.
Under no circumstances should a patient kiss
or have intercourse if there is even the slightest sore
or chafe on the parts, regardless of whether or not
it is thought to be syphilitic.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Articles of Personal Use.</span>&mdash;Persons with a tendency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
to recurrences in the mouth or elsewhere should
report to the physician any sore they may discover
and should watch for them. Persons with syphilitic
sores in the mouth or elsewhere should have their
own dishes, towels, toilet articles, shaving tools,
pipes, silverware, and personal articles, and should
not exchange or permit others to use them.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Secrecy.</span>&mdash;Professional secrecy is something to
which the syphilitic is most certainly entitled when
it can be had without danger to the public health.
So long as a syphilitic in the contagious period carefully
observes the principles which ought to govern
him in his relations to others, his condition is his
own concern. But there is one person within the
family who should, as a rule, know of his infection if
it is still in the contagious period, since it is almost
impossible to secure co&ouml;peration otherwise. No
matter how painful it may be, a person with syphilis,
if advised to do so by his physician, should tell husband
or wife the true state of affairs. There is no
harder duty, often, and none which, if manfully performed,
should inspire more respect. For those
who will not follow his advice in this matter the
physician cannot assume any responsibility, and is
fully justified, and in fact wise, if he decline to undertake
the case.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Re-infection.</span>&mdash;Since it is a common misconception,
it cannot be said too forcibly that no person
with syphilis should forget that his having had the
disease does not confer any immunity, and that as
soon as he is cured he may acquire it again. It is
possible, by a single exposure to infection, to undo the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
whole effect of what has been done, just after a cure
is accomplished. There can be only one safe rule
for infected as well as uninfected persons&mdash;to keep
away from the risk of syphilis.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Quacks and Self-treatment.</span>&mdash;Hot Springs.&mdash;The
temptation to take up quack forms of treatment or
to treat himself without the advice of a physician
besets the path of the syphilitic throughout the
course of the disease; an enormous number of fraudulent
enterprises thrive on the credulity of its victims.
Most of them are of the patent medicine
specific type. Others, however, have a tinge of
respectability and are dangerous simply because
they are insufficient and not carried out under proper
direction. Many popular superstitions as to the
value of baths in syphilis and of the usefulness of a
short course of rubs with bathing, or a "trip to the
springs," are of this kind. Enough has been said
in the foregoing chapters to make it plain to any one
who is open to conviction that syphilis is no affair
for the patient himself to attempt to treat. The
best judgment of the most skilled physicians is the
least that the victim owes himself in his effort to
get well.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Patient and Physician.</span>&mdash;For the same reasons
every person who has or has had syphilis, cured or
not, or has been exposed to it, should make it an
absolute rule to inform his physician of the fact.
The recognition of many obscure conditions in
medicine depends on this knowledge. For a patient
to falsify the facts or to ignore or conceal them
is simply to work against his own interests and to
hinder his physician in his efforts to benefit him.</p>

<h3>Mental Attitudes in Their Relation to Syphilis</h3>

<p>One's way of looking at a thing has an immense
influence on what one does about it. Obvious as
this principle is in the every-day affairs of life, it
becomes still more obvious as one studies a disease
and watches the way in which different individuals
react to it. The state of mind of a few people infected
with a rare condition may not seem a matter
of more than passing interest, but in a disease which
is a wide-spread and disastrous influence in human
life, the sum-total of our states of mind about it
determines what we do against it and, to no small
degree, what it does to us. Syphilis as a medical
problem offers comparatively few difficulties at the
present day. What blocks our progress now is
largely an affair of mental attitudes, of prejudices,
of fears, or shame, of ignorance, stupidity, or indifference.
Mental strain, a powerful influence in many
diseases, is a factor in syphilis also, and the state of
mind of the patient has often almost as much to
do with the success of his treatment as has salvarsan
or mercury. For that reason it is worth while to
devote a chapter to picturing in a general way the
mental side of syphilis.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Public Attitude Toward Syphilis.</span>&mdash;First of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
all, in order to understand the mental state of the
patient, consider once more the attitude of the world
at large toward the victim of syphilis. A few who
are frankly ignorant of the existence of the disease
to start with are unprejudiced when approached in
the right way. But ninety-eight persons in a hundred
who know that there is such a disease as syphilis
are alive to the fact that it is considered a disgrace
to have it, and to little else. Such a feeling
naturally chokes all but secret discussion of it.
Most of us remember the day when newspaper copy
containing reference to tuberculosis did not find
ready publication. Syphilis is just crossing this
same threshold into publicity. It is now possible
to get the name of the disease into print outside of
medical works and to have it referred to in other
ways than as "blood poisoning" in quack advertisements.
The mention of it in lectures on sex
hygiene is an affair of the last twenty years, and the
earlier discussions of the disease on such occasions
were only too often vague, prejudiced, and inaccurate.
There are many who still believe, as did an
old librarian whom I met in my effort to reach an
important reference work on syphilis in a great public
library. "We used to keep them on the shelves,"
he said, "until the high school boys began to get
interested, and then we thought we would reserve
the subject for the profession." Syphilis has been
reserved for the profession for five hundred years
and the disease has grown fat on it. The lean times
will come when a reasonable curiosity about syphilis
can be satisfied without either shame or secrecy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
by a reasonable presentation of the facts. We need
the light on this subject and the light on reserved
shelves is notoriously poor. The stigma attaching
to syphilis as a disease is one of the most tragic examples
of a great wrong done to do a little right.
What if there are a few who deserve what they got?
We may well ask ourselves how free we are to cast
the first stone. And why single out syphilis as the
badge of venery? The "itch" is transmitted by
sexual relations too. Why not make the itch a
sign of shame? The power that has done the damage
is not the intrinsic viciousness of syphilis, but the
survival of the old idea of sexual taboo, the feeling
that sex is a secret, shameful thing, essentially unclean.
To this age-old myth some one added the idea
of punishment, and brutalized our conception of
syphilis for centuries. If there were a semblance
of crude, stern justice in accepting syphilis as the
divinely established punishment for sexual wrong-doing,
protest would lose half its meaning. Not
only does syphilis fail to punish justly, but there is
also something savage, akin almost to the mental
attitude that makes "frightfulness" possible in war,
in the belief that it is necessary to make headway
against a sexual enemy by torturing, ruining, and
dismembering men, women, and children, putting
out the eyes of the boy who made a slip through bad
companionship and mutilating the girl who loved
"not wisely but too well." Only innocence pays the
spiritual price of syphilis. The very ones whose
punishment it should be are the most indifferent to
it, and the least influenced by fear of it in their pursuit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of sexual gratification. I always recall with a
shock the utterance of a university professor in the
days when salvarsan was expected to cure syphilis
at a single dose. He rated it as a catastrophe that
any such drug should have been discovered, because
he felt that it would remove a great barrier to promiscuous
relations between men and women&mdash;the
fear of venereal disease. This is the point of view
that perpetuates the disease among us. It is this
attitude of mind that maintains an atmosphere of
disgrace and secrecy and shame about a great problem
in public health and muddles our every attempt
to solve it. Those who feel syphilis to be an instrument
adapted to warfare against sexual mistakes,
and are prepared to concede "frightfulness" to be
honorable warfare, will, of course, fold their hands
and smugly roll their eyes as they repeat the words
of the secretary of a London Lock hospital, "I
don't believe in making it safe."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Quoted by Flexner in "Prostitution in Europe."</p></div>

<p><span class="caption">Syphilis as a "Disgrace" and a "Moral Force."</span>&mdash;If
syphilis really deterred, really acted as an efficient
preventive of license, we might have to tolerate
this attitude of mind, even though we disagreed
with it. I had occasion, during a period of two years,
to live in the most intimate association with about
800 people who had syphilis&mdash;every kind of person
from the top to the bottom of the social scale. It
was not a simple matter of ordering pills for them
from the pharmacy, or castor oil from the medicine
room. I had to sit beside their beds when they
heard the truth; I had to see the women crumple up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
and go limp; I had to tell the blind child's father
that he did it, to bolster up the weak girl, to rebuild
the wife's broken ideals, to suppress the rowdy and
the roysterer, to hear the vows of the boy who was
paying for his first mistake, and listen to the stories
of the pimp and the seducer. What made syphilis
terrible to the many really fine and upright spirits
in the mass thus flung together in a common bondage?
It was not the fear of paresis, or of any other
consequence of the disease. It was the torture of
disgrace, unearned shame, burnt into their backs by
those who think syphilis a weapon against prostitution
and a punishment for sin. It wrecked some of
them effectually&mdash;left them nothing to live for. It
case-hardened others against the world in a way
you and I can well pray we may never be case-hardened.
It left scars on others, and others laughed
it off. Hundreds of sexual offenders passed through
my hands, and in the closest study of their points
of view I was unable to find that in more than rare
cases had the risk of syphilis any real power to control
the expression of their desires. Sexual morality
is a complex affair, in which the habit of self-control
in many other activities of life plays an important
part. The man or woman who best deserves to be
called clean and honorable and sexually blameless
has not become so through a negative morality and
an enlightened selfishness. The man who does not
have bred into him from childhood the instinct to
say the "everlasting no" to his passions will never
learn to say it from the fear of syphilis. Sexual self-control
is a habit, not a reasoned-out affair, and its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
foundation must rest on the rock bottom of character
and not in the muck of venereal disease.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Broader Outlook.</span>&mdash;If, then, it avails nothing
in the uplifting of our morals to treat syphilis as a
disgrace, if the disease is ineffective as a deterrent,
and barbarously undiscriminating, inhuman, and
unjust as a punishment, let us in all fairness lay
aside the attitude of mind which has so hindered and
defeated our efforts to deal with it as an arch enemy
to human health, happiness, and effectiveness. In
the face of all our harsh traditions it takes a good
deal of breadth of view to look on the disease impersonally,
rather than in the light of one or two
contemptible examples of it whom we may happen
to know. But, after all, to think in large terms and
with a sympathy that can separate the sinner from
his sin and the sick man from the folly that got the
best of him, is no mean achievement, well worthy of
the Samaritan in contrast with the Levite. To the
remaking of the traditional attitude of harsh, unkindly
judgment upon those unfortunate enough to
have a terrible disease, we must look for our soundest
hope of progress.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Mental States of Syphilitics.</span>&mdash;The mental
outlook of the person with syphilis is in its turn as
important a factor in our campaign against the disease
as is that of the person without it. In order to
give some idea of the ways in which this can influence
the situation it may be well to sketch what might
be called the four types of mind with which one has
to deal&mdash;the conscientious, the average, the irresponsible,
and the morbid. Under the morbid type are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
included those persons who, without having syphilis,
are in morbid fear of the disease, or have the fixed
belief that they are infected with it, even when they
are not.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Conscientious Type.</span>&mdash;Conscientious patients,
speaking from the physician's standpoint, are the
product of intelligence and character combined.
Though distinctly in the minority, and usually met
in the better grades of private practice, one is often
surprised how many there are, considering the
treacherous and deceptive features of the disease,
which leave so much excuse for laxity and misunderstanding
on the part of the laymen. A conscientious
patient is one who is not content with any
ideal short of that of radical cure. It takes unselfishness
and self-control to go without those things
which make the patient in the infectious stage
dangerous to others. For a time life seems pretty
well stripped of its pleasures for the man who may not
smoke, must always think beforehand whether any
contact which he makes with persons or things about
him may subject others to risk of infection, and
perhaps must meet the misunderstanding and condemnation
of others whom he has to take into his
confidence for the same purpose. An element of
moral courage and a keen sense of personal responsibility
help to make the ideal patient in this disease.
To meet a treatment appointment promptly at the
same day and hour week after week, to go through
the drudgery of rubbing mercurial ointment, for
example, to say nothing of the unpleasantness of
the method to a cleanly person, night after night for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
weeks, takes unmistakable grit and a well-developed
sense of moral obligation. The man who has been
cured of syphilis has passed through a discipline
which calls for the best in him, and repays him in
terms of better manhood as well as better health.</p>

<p>The physician's co&ouml;peration in the development
of the necessary sense of responsibility and the
requisite character basis for a successful treatment
is invaluable. To the large majority of the victims
of the disease it is a severe shock to find out what
ails them. Many of them, without saying much
about it, give up all hope for a worth-while life
from the moment they learn of their condition.
Just as in the old days the belief that consumption
was incurable cost nearly as many lives as the disease
itself, by leading victims to give up the fight
when a little persistence would have won it, so
among many who acquire syphilis, especially when
it is contracted under distressing circumstances,
there is a lowering of the victims' fighting strength,
a sapping of their courage which makes them an
easy prey to the indifference to cure that is so fatal
in this disease. The person with syphilis should
have the benefit of all the friendly counsel, reassurance,
and moral support that his physician can give,
and such time and labor on the latter's part are richly
repaid.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Average State of Mind.</span>&mdash;The average mental
attitude stops tantalizingly short of the best type of
conscientiousness. Average patients are good co&ouml;perators
in the beginning of a course of treatment
or while the symptoms are alarming or obvious, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
their energy leaves them once they are outwardly
cured. The average patient only too often overrules
his physician's good judgment on trivial
grounds, slight inconveniences, and temporary considerations,
forgetting that cure is what he needs
more than anything else in the world. The deprivations
go hard with this type of patients, and it is
difficult, almost impossible, to persuade them to stop
smoking or to abstain from sexual relations or other
contacts that are apt to subject others to risk.
Average patients will almost never remain under the
care of a physician until cured. A year, or at the
most two years, is all that can be expected, and a
second or third negative blood test is usually the
signal for their disappearance. They are, of course,
lost in the great unknown of syphilis, and swell the
total of deaths from internal causes of syphilitic
origin, such as diseases of the arteries and of the
nervous system. A good many have to be treated
for relapses, but the amount of infection spread by
them, while of course unknown, is probably small
considering how many of them there are.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Effect of the High Cost of Treatment.</span>&mdash;A factor
which is extremely influential in forcing average
treatment and ideals on those who, if opportunity
were more abundant, would be conscientious about
the disease, has already been mentioned as the cost
of treatment, which is such that persons with small
incomes, who are too proud or sensitive to seek charitable
aid, can scarcely be expected to meet. The
cost of salvarsan under present conditions is a burden
that few can hope to assume to the extent that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
modern treatment tends to require, and the slower
methods of treatment are more of a tax on the patient's
courage and determination, and less effective
in preventing the danger of infectiousness, although
quite as reliable for cure. There is no more serious
problem in the public health movement against
syphilis than to get for the average man who can
pay a moderate but not a large fee the benefits of
expensive and elaborate methods of recognizing and
treating a disease such as syphilis. Some practical
methods of doing this will be taken up in the next
chapter.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Irresponsible.</span>&mdash;The irresponsible attitude of
mind about syphilis forms the background of the
darkest and most repellent chapter in the story of
the disease. Yet we ought to confront it if we wish
to master the situation. The irresponsible person
has either no regard for, or no conception of, the
rights of others where a dangerous contagious disease
is concerned, and often little conception of, and less
interest in, what is to his own ultimate advantage.
Irresponsible syphilitics lack character first and
sense next. Many of them, through the gods-defying
combination of stupidity and ignorance, cannot
be approached through any channel of reason or
persuasion. The only argument capable of influencing
such minds is compulsion. Others are, of course,
mental defectives with criminal and perverted tendencies.
Yet it is both amazing and discouraging to
find how many irresponsibles there are in the ordinary
and even in the better walks of life. To the
wilful type of irresponsible person the transmission<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
of a syphilitic infection is nothing, and cannot weigh
a straw against the gratification of his desire or the
pursuit of his own interest. The disease cannot
teach such people anything, and if it cannot, how
can the physician? Such people pursue their personal
and sexual pleasure, marry, spread disaster
around them, and outlive it all, perhaps brazenly
to acknowledge the fact. Others, suave, attractive,
agreeable, seductive, often masquerade as respectability,
or constitute the perfumed, the romantic,
the elegant carriers of disease. The proportion of
ignorant to wilful irresponsibility can scarcely be
estimated. But there is little choice between the
two except on the score of the hopefulness of the
latter. As examples of the mixture of types with
which a large hospital is constantly dealing, I might
offer the following at random, from my own recollections:
A milkman came to a clinic one morning
with an eruption all over his body and his mouth
full of the most dangerously contagious patches.
Two of us cornered him and explained to him in full
why he should come in if only for twenty-four hours.
He promised to be back next morning and disappeared.
Another, a butcher in the same condition,
put his wife, whom he had already infected, into the
hospital, and in spite of every argument by all
the members of the staff, went home to attend to his
business&mdash;the selling of meat over the counter. A
lunch-room helper, literally oozing germs, was after
several days induced to come up for an examination
and promised to begin treatment, whereupon he
disappeared. A college student reported with an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
early primary sore. "X&mdash;&mdash;," I said, "If you
will pledge me your honor as a gentleman never to
take another chance and not to marry until I say
you are cured I will use salvarsan on you, which is
just about as scarce as gold now, and give you a
chance for abortive cure." He pledged himself,
and six months later there was every sign that we
were going to secure a perfect result. Suddenly he
failed to appear for a treatment appointment, and I
never saw him again. But I did see a letter written
to him by the clinic which showed that he had come
up for the examination with a newly acquired sore
while he knew I was away&mdash;in all probability a reinfection.
He was not even man enough to face
me with his broken word. Three or four men with
chancres may report in an afternoon and leave, the
clinic powerless to detain them or to protect others
against the damage they may do. One such, a
Greek boy, had exposed four different women to
infection before we saw him, and only the most
strenuous efforts of the entire staff got him into the
hospital, because he had neither money nor sense.
Half-witted tramps, gang laborers, and foreigners
who cannot understand a word of any other language
than Lithuanian or some other of the European
dialects for which no interpreter can be secured,
pass in a steady stream through the free clinics of
large cities. The impossibility of securing even the
simplest co&ouml;peration from such patients is scarcely
realized by any one who is not called upon to deal
with them face to face. Even with an interpreter,
they display the wilfulness of irresponsibility. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Italian woman wiped her chancre, which was on her
lip, with her fingers at every other shake of the head.
She was cooking for two boarders and had two children.
She did not like hospitals and was homesick
and pettish. Would she go over to the dispensary
in the next block and find out how to take care of
herself? Not a bit of it. She was going home, and
she went. I saw the children later in the children's
ward, both infected with syphilis&mdash;a poor start in
life. Criminal intent in the transmission of syphilis
is common enough, and the writer can think off-hand
of four or five cases in which men or women
"got" their estranged partners later in their careers.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Necessity for Legal Control.</span>&mdash;All these repulsive
details have a place in driving home a conception
of the cost to society of the immoral and
irresponsible syphilitic. Syphilis is an infectious
disease, dangerous to the individual and to society.
If it is rational to quarantine a mouth and throat
full of diphtheria germs, it is rational to quarantine a
mouth and throat full of syphilitic germs at least
until the germs are killed off for the time being.
There can be no more excuse for placing society at
the mercy of the one than of the other.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Morbid Attitude of Mind: Syphilophobia.</span>&mdash;The
morbid attitude of mind, whether in persons
who have the disease or in those who fear they may
have it, is one of the hardest the physician has to
deal with. Any one who knows anything of the
disease naturally has a healthy desire to avoid it,
and if he is a victim of it, a considerable belief in its
seriousness. But certain types of persons, who are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
usually predisposed to it by a nervous makeup, or
who have a tendency to brood over things, or who
perhaps have heard some needlessly dreadful presentation
of the facts, become the victims of an
actual mental disorder, a temporary unbalancing
of their point of view. To the victims of syphilophobia,
as this condition is called, syphilis fills the
whole horizon. If they have not been too seriously
disturbed by the idea, a simple statement of the
facts does wonders toward relieving their minds.
A few of them cling with the greatest tenacity to
the most absurd notions. For those victims of the
disease who are the prey of morbid anxiety the assurance
that it is one of the most curable of all the
serious diseases, and that if they are persistent and
determined to get well, they can scarcely help doing
so, usually sets their minds at rest. The idea that
there is a cloud of disgrace over the whole subject,
and the old-fashioned belief that syphilis is incurable
and hopeless, inflict needless torture and may
do serious damage to the highly organized sensitive
spirits which it is to society's best interest to conserve.
The overconscientious syphilitic hardly realizes
that the real horrors of the disease are usually
the rewards of indifference rather than overanxiety.
Persons who subject themselves to the ordinary
risks of infection which have been described in the
preceding chapters do well to be on their guard and
to maintain even a somewhat exaggerated caution.
Those who do not expose themselves need not look
upon the disease with morbid anxiety or alarm. In
the relations of life in which syphilis is likely to be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
factor it should, of course, be ferreted out. But
there is no occasion for panic. We need a sane consciousness
of the disease, a knowledge of its ways and
of the means of prevention and cure for the world at
large. We do not need hysteria, whether personal
or general, and there is nothing in the facts of the
situation to warrant the development of such a
mental attitude either on the part of the syphilitic
or of those by whom he is surrounded. Insofar as
morbid fear in otherwise normal persons is the
product of ignorance it can be dispelled by convincing
them of this fact.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_XV" id="Chapter_XV"></a>Chapter XV</h2>

<h3>Moral and Personal Prophylaxis</h3>

<p>Prophylaxis, of course, means prevention, and it
has been a large part of the purpose of the present
study to deal with syphilis from the standpoint of
prevention and cure. The material of this chapter
is, therefore, only a special aspect of the larger problem.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Repression of Prostitution.</span>&mdash;By the moral prophylaxis
of syphilis is meant the cultivation of such moral
ideals as will contribute to the control of a disease
which is so closely associated with sexual irregularities.
Since public and secret prostitution serve as
the principal agencies for the dissemination of the
disease, it follows that anything tending to decrease
the amount of disease in prostitutes, on the one hand,
or to diminish the amount of promiscuous sexual
activity, on the other, will retard the spread of syphilis.
Systems based on the first ideas, aiming rather
to control the disease in public women by inspection
of their health and activities than by suppressing
prostitution, have failed because the methods of
control ordinarily practised are worthless for the
detection of infectiousness. So-called regulation
has, therefore, given way very largely in progressive
communities to the second ideal of repressing or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
abolishing the outward evidences of vice as far as
possible. In behalf of sanitary control of prostitution,
leaving out of the question its moral aspect,
it must be admitted that Neisser, probably the
greatest authority on the sexual diseases, believed
that, as far as syphilis is concerned, the use of salvarsan
as a means of preventing infection from prostitutes
has never had a satisfactory trial. In behalf
of abolition it would seem that systematic stamping-out
of the outward evidences of vice, the making of
immorality less attractive and conspicuous, is, in
theory at least, a valuable means of diminishing the
extent and availability of an important source of
infection.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Educational Influences.</span>&mdash;To do something positive
against an evil is certainly a more promising
mode of attack than to use only the negative force
of repression of temptation. Education of public
opinion offers us just such a positive mode of attack.
Men and women and boys and girls should first be
taught sexual self-control even before being made
aware of the risk they run in throwing aside the conventional
moral code. Teach honor first and prudence
next. The slogan of education in sexual self-restraint
is the easiest to utter and the most difficult
to put into practice of all the schemes for the control
of sexual diseases. A large part of the difficulty
of making education effective arises from one or two
situations which are worth thinking over.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Economic Forces Opposing Sexual Self-control.</span>&mdash;In
the first place, while continence, or abstinence
from sexual relations, is a valuable ideal in its place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
it cannot be indefinitely extended with benefit either
to the individual or to the race. The instinct to
reproduce is as fundamental as the instinct of self-preservation
and the desire for food. A social order
which disregards it or defies it will meet defeat.
To an alarming extent the tendency of the present
economic system is to create unsocial impulses by
making the normal gratification of sexual instinct in
marriage and the assumption of the responsibility of
a family more and more difficult. The cost of living
is steadily rising without a corresponding certainty
on the part of a large proportion of young men that
they can meet it for themselves, to say nothing of
meeting it for wife and children. The uncertainties
of a 'job' are often serious enough to discourage the
rashest of men from depending on a variable earning
power to help him do his share for the advancement
of the race. It will be an impossible task to convince
even naturally clean-minded, healthy young men and
women that they should live a life of hopeless virtue
because it is part of the divine order that they should
be so held down by hard times and small earnings as
to make marrying and having children an unattainable
luxury. Continence and clean living as preparations
for decent and reasonably early marriage and
the raising of a healthy family are the highest of
ideals, and ought to be preached from every housetop.
Continence as a life-long punishment for the
impossible demands of an oppressive social and economic
order gets as little attention as it deserves.
First, let us make a clean sexual life lead with greater
certainty to some of the rewards that make life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
worth living and we shall then have a more substantial
basis for making continence before marriage
other than empty words. If every father, for example,
could say to his sons and daughters that if
they showed themselves clean men and women he
would back them in an early marriage, there would
be an appreciable decrease in the amount of young
manhood which is now squandered on indecency.
If every employer, or the state itself, would give a
clean marriage a preferred position in the social and
economic scale, and, by helping to meet the cost of
it, recognize in a substantial way the value to the
race of a family of vigorous children, an important
factor in youthful sexual laxity would be robbed of
its power. No one will assert that such remedial
proposals are of themselves cure-alls for present
evils, but they must have at least an emphatic place
in the future of moral prophylaxis.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Teaching of Sexual Self-control.</span>&mdash;First
then, make the social order such that sexual self-control
yields a reward and not a punishment. Second,
teach sexual control itself, since it is one of the
fundamental means of attack on the problem of
syphilis. How can such control be taught? Information
about the physical dangers of illicit sexual
indulgence is of course of value, and should be spread
broadcast. But taken by itself, the fear of disease,
especially if it enters the individual's life after the
age when he has already experienced the force of his
sexual instincts, is a feeble influence. The person
who has nothing but the knowledge that he is taking
great risks between him and the gratification of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
sexual desires will take the risks and take them once
too often. One cannot begin to teach the boy or
girl of high school age that sexual offenses mean
physical disaster, and expect to control syphilis.
The time to control the future of the sexual diseases
is in the toddler at the knee, the child whose daily
lesson in self-control will culminate when he says the
final 'No' to his passions as a man. The child
who does not learn to respect his body in the act of
brushing his teeth and taking his bath and exercise,
and whose thought and speech and temper are unbridled
by any self-restraint, will give little heed
when told not to abuse his manhood by exposing
himself to filth. The prevention of syphilis by
sexual self-control goes down to the foundations of
character, and has practical value only in those
whose self-control is the expression of a lifelong
habit of self-discipline bred in the bone from childhood,
not merely painted on the surface at puberty.
Those who want their sons and daughters never to
know by personal experience the meaning of syphilis
must first build a foundation in character for
them which will make self-control in them instinctive,
almost automatic. Knowledge of sexual matters
has power only in proportion to the strength of
the character that wields it, and on well-rounded
character education, rather than mere knowledge of
the facts, the soundest results will be based.</p>

<p>The moral prophylaxis of syphilis is then briefly
summed up in the repression of as many of the
recognized agencies for the spread of the disease as
possible; the making of continence a preparation for
a normal sex life rather than an end in itself; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
control and remedying of those influences which are
making normal marriage harder of attainment;
and the development of an instinctive self-control
and self-discipline in every field of life from childhood
up as the character basis necessary to make
knowledge about sexual life and sexual disease effective.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Personal Preventive Methods.</span>&mdash;Continence.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;There
remains to be considered what is often called
the personal prophylaxis of syphilis, meaning thereby
the methods by which the individual himself
can diminish or escape the risk of infection. The
first and most effective method of avoiding syphilis
is abstinence from sexual relations and intimacies
except in normal marriage with a healthy person.
Although it has been alluded to under the moral
prophylaxis of syphilis, it deserves to be re&euml;mphasized.
No consideration as to the justice or desirability
of continence and self-restraint can add anything
to the simple fact that it is <i>the</i> way to avoid
disease, and can be unhesitatingly recommended as
the standard for personal prophylaxis. In the experience
of physicians it is an axiom that disillusionment
sooner or later overtakes those who think they
are exempt from this rule. Persons who discard
continence in favor of what they believe to be some
absolutely safe indulgence are so almost invariably
deceived that the exceptions are not worth considering.
Although infection with syphilis is no necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
evidence of unclean living, clean living will
always remain the best method of avoiding syphilis.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> The American Social Hygiene Association, 105 W. 40th Street,
New York City, can supply pamphlets and lists of authoritative publications
bearing on this and related subjects.</p></div>

<p><span class="caption">The Metchnikoff Prophylaxis.</span>&mdash;The second method
of personal prophylaxis of syphilis was developed
as a result of the discovery of Metchnikoff and Roux
in 1906, that a specially prepared ointment containing
a mercurial salt, if rubbed into the place on which
the germs were deposited within a few hours (not
exceeding eighteen hours, and the sooner the better)
after exposure to the risk of syphilis, would prevent
the disease by killing the germs before they could
gain a foothold. This method of protection against
syphilis has been subjected to rigid tests, with fairly
satisfactory results. It has been adopted by the
army and navy of practically every country in the
world, and, as carried out under the direction of
physicians and with military control of the patient,
has apparently reduced the amount of syphilitic
infection acquired in the armies and navies using
it to a remarkable degree. The method, of course,
cannot assume to be infallible, but if intelligently
applied, it is one of the important weapons for the
extinction of syphilis in our hands at the present
day. It fails to meet expectations precisely in those
circumstances and among those persons in whom
intelligent employment of it cannot be expected.
This of course covers a considerable number of those
who acquire syphilis. What disposal an awakened
opinion will make of this knowledge remains to be
seen. At the present time it may well be doubted
whether the indiscriminate placing of it in the hands
of anybody and everybody would not work as much
harm as good through ignorant and unintelligent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
use. This opinion is shared by European as well as
American authorities. Administered under the direction
of a physician, the Metchnikoff prophylaxis of
syphilis would undoubtedly be at its best in the prevention
of the disease. For these reasons, as well as
to prevent the spread of the knowledge to those who
would be damaged by it, those interested are referred
to their physicians for a description of the
method. Any one having the benefit of it should
be able to convince his medical advisor that there
is good reason why this kind of professional knowledge
should be brought to bear on his case. The
ordinary methods of preventing infection by washes
and similar applications used by the "knowing
ones" are most of them worthless or greatly inferior
to the Metchnikoff prophylaxis. They are,
moreover, a positive source of danger because of the
false sense of security which they create. If every
person who has run the risk of contracting syphilis
should visit his physician <i>at once</i> to receive prophylactic
treatment, the effect on syphilis at large would
probably be as good as in the army and navy. There
would still be opportunity on such occasions to
bring moral forces and influence to bear on those
who would respond to them. There can be no object
in withholding such knowledge from those who
are confirmed in their irregular sexual habits. At
the same time there could be few better influences
thrown across the path of one just starting on a
wrong track than that exerted by a physician of
skill and character, to whom the individual had appealed
to avert the possible disastrous result of an
indiscretion.</p>

<h3>Public Effort Against Syphilis</h3>

<p><span class="caption">The World-wide Movement Against Venereal
Disease.</span>&mdash;This chapter is intended to give some
account of the great movements now begun to control
syphilis and its fellow-diseases throughout the
world. A campaign of publicity was the starting-point
of the organized attempt to control tuberculosis,
and in the same way a similar campaign has
been at the bottom of movements which now, under
the pressure of the tremendous necessities of war, are
making headway at a pace that generations of talking
and thinking in peaceful times could not have
brought about. Although this country at the present
writing is probably farther in the rear than any
other great nation of the world in its efforts to control
the venereal diseases as a national problem, it is
fortunate in having had the way paved for it by
epoch-making movements such as those of the Scandinavian
countries, and by the studies of the Sydenham
Royal Commission on whose findings the British
Government is now undertaking the greatest
single movement against syphilis and gonorrhea that
has ever been launched. For many years Germany
has had a society whose roll includes some of the
greatest names in modern science, directing all its
energy toward the solution of the problem of sexual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
disease, and German sentiment on these matters is
developing so fast that it is difficult, even for those
in touch with such matters, to keep pace with it.
In this country progress has been much slower,
hampered by peculiarities of mental outlook and
tradition very different from those which have controlled
the thought of Europe. The association of
syphilis with prostitution has been largely instrumental
in putting much valuable statistical and
general knowledge of the disease into semi-private
reports and sources not available to the large mass of
the thinking public. The effect of finding the problem
of syphilis invariably bound up with discussions
of the social evil has been to perpetuate in popular
thought an association which simply blocks the way
to any solution of the public health problem. While
the control of prostitution will influence syphilis,
ignoring syphilis, or treating it as incidental, will
never contribute anything to the conquest of either.
It is one of the most significant features of the great
movements now on foot all over the world that they
have finally adopted the direct route, and are attacking
syphilis and gonorrhea as diseases and not
by way of their association with prostitution.</p>

<p>The agencies in this country which are making
notable efforts to push the campaign against syphilis
and gonorrhea deserve every possible support from
the thinking public. The American Social Hygiene
Association is a clearing-house for trustworthy information
in regard to the problems of sexual disease,
and publishes a quarterly journal.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The National<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Committee for Mental Hygiene and its branch
societies are also engaged in spreading knowledge of
the relation of syphilis to mental disease and degeneration.
State and City Boards of Health are active
in their efforts to further the campaign, and notable
work is being done by New York City, Buffalo,
Cleveland, and Rochester, New York, both on publicity
and in the provision of facilities for recognizing
and treating the diseases in question. Certain
states, such as Ohio, Michigan, and Vermont, have
made steps toward an intelligent legislative attack
on different aspects of the problem. Influential
newspapers and magazines have made the idea of a
campaign against these diseases familiar enough to
the public, for example, to bring a young girl to me
to ask outright without affectation that she be told
about syphilis, because she had seen the word in the
paper and did not fully understand it. The aggregate
of these forces is large, and an awakening is
inevitable.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Social Hygiene, New York.</p></div>

<p>To prepare ourselves for an active and intelligent
share in the movement, we should review briefly
the essential elements of a public campaign against
syphilis as they have been developed by recent investigations
and legislative experiments.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Undesirable and Freak Legislation.</span>&mdash;Syphilis has
had a limited amount of recognition in law, unfortunately
not always wise or timely. Freak legislation
and half-baked schemes are the familiar preliminaries
which precede the grim onset of a real attack supported
by public sentiment. Typical examples of
such premature legislation may be found in the setting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
up of the Wassermann test as evidence of fitness
for marriage by certain states, and in the efforts
of certain official agencies to enforce the reporting
of syphilis and gonorrhea by name. Proposals to
quarantine and placard all syphilis are in the same
category, though seriously entertained by some. The
plan to establish by state enactment or municipal
appropriation special venereal hospitals falls in the
same class, since it is obvious that in the present
state of opinion none but down-and-outs would resort
to them. The stigma attached to them would
effectually make them useless to the very group of
worth-while people which it is to the public interest
to conserve and re&euml;ducate.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Value of Conservative Action.</span>&mdash;It cannot be said
too often that a reasonable conservatism should
temper the ardor of reformers, or more harm than
good will be done by the collapse and failure of ill-considered
special legislation. Unified action against
syphilis and gonorrhea as public health problems is as
important as unified action on the problems of railroad
control, child labor, or corporate monopoly.
For that reason it is a matter of some uncertainty
how much can be accomplished by individual states
in this country in the way of restrictive legislation,
such as that controlling the marriage of infected persons,
or punishing persons who fail to carry treatment
to the point of cure. Under the direction of a
national bureau or department of health administration
there is no doubt that the movement against
syphilis would advance at a much more rapid pace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
than with the sporadic and scattered activities of
mixed state and private agencies.</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Essential Features of a Modern Campaign.</span>&mdash;The
repeated sifting of the facts which has been done
in recent years by important investigations, such as
that of the Sydenham Commission in Great Britain
and the Society for Combatting Sexual Disease in
Germany, and the legislative programs already mentioned,
have gradually crystallized into fairly definite
form, the undoubted essentials of a program for
controlling venereal diseases, syphilis among them.
These may be summarized as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>The provision of universally available good
treatment, at the expense of the state, if necessary,
for the diseases in question.</li>

<li>The provision by the state of efficient means of
recognizing the diseases at the earliest possible time
and with the greatest possible certainty in any given
case.</li>

<li>The suppression of quack practice, drug-store
prescribing, and advertising of cures for these diseases.</li>

<li>Moral and educational prophylaxis and the
vigorous suppression of prostitution.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to these measures, which are common to
all proposals and working systems for the control of
sexual disease, certain other recommendations may
be classed as debatable, inasmuch as they are still
under discussion and have been incorporated into
some and omitted from others. These are as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<ol>
<li>General instruction in personal prophylaxis for
the population at large.</li>

<li>Compulsory measures and penalties obliging
patients to receive treatment and continue it until
cured, regardless of their own desires in the matter.</li>

<li>Notification or reporting of cases of sexual disease
to the health authorities.</li>

<li>Indirect legislation, as it might be called, which
aims to detect infected persons before they enter on
marriage rather than at the outset of the disease,
either by releasing the physician in charge of the
case from the bond of professional confidence, or by
requiring health certificates before marriage, and
which annuls marriages after infection is discovered.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="caption">Easily Available Treatment.</span>&mdash;It will be noticed
that toleration of prostitution with supervision has
finally disappeared from the modern program for the
control of sexual diseases. The provision for universally
available treatment, regardless of the patient's
means or circumstances, should be thought of
as the one fundamental requirement without which
no program has made even a beginning. For over a
century Denmark has provided for the free treatment
of all patients with venereal disease. The Norwegian
law, essentially similar, dates from 1860.
Italy a few years ago adopted a similar program,
placing squarely upon the state the responsibility of
providing for the care of all patients with venereal
diseases. England has just adopted a mixed provision
which will in practice place most of the responsibility
upon the state and very little on the
individual, as far as the expense of treatment is concerned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Germany has compelled her insurance
companies to shoulder the burden, and under pressure
of war is hastening matters by invoking more
and more governmental aid. The recent West
Australian Act provides that every medical officer
in the pay of the state shall treat venereal disease
free of charge. In comparison with the tremendous
advances over previous indifference which such programs
represent, this country makes a poor showing.
Among us, no public agency is formally charged
with any duty in the matter of preventing, recognizing,
or treating the vast amount of venereal infection
that mars our national health. Certain
state boards of health are attempting to perform
Wassermann tests, and certain municipalities have
well-organized laboratories for the detection of
syphilis and gonorrhea, but there are few purely
public agencies that even pretend to have a specialist
in their employ to assist in the recognition of cases
and conduct the treatment of patients who cannot
afford private care. Hospital and dispensary treatment
of venereal diseases is almost entirely in semi-private
hands, and a recent investigation of clinics
and dispensaries for the treatment of syphilis and
gonorrhea in New York city, for example, showed
that many of them were so poorly equipped and
run at such unreasonable hours that they were frequented
only by vagabonds, were of no value in the
early recognition of syphilis, could not administer
salvarsan under conditions to which a discriminating
patient would dare to trust himself, and made no
pretense at following their cases beyond the door or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
discharging them from medical care as cured. One
of the largest cities in this country until a year ago
had not even a night clinic to which day workers
could come, and is scarcely awake now to the necessity
for such a thing.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Dispensary Service.</span>&mdash;The provision of adequate
treatment and diagnostic facilities, on a par with
those which will presently cover Europe, will mean
the following things: First of all, dispensaries, and
many of them, for the identification of early cases,
fully equipped with dark-field microscopes, with
record systems, and with the means for following
patients from the time they enter until they are
cured. This means nurses, it means social service
workers, it means doctors with special and not general
knowledge of syphilis and gonorrhea. The
Brooklyn Hospital Dispensary is an admirable
example of what such an institution should be, but
it is one where such institutions should be numbered
by dozens and by hundreds. Copenhagen, with a
population less than that of several cities in this
country which have none, has seven municipal
clinics whose hours and names are prominently advertised.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Hospitals.</span>&mdash;In the second place there must be
hospital facilities. They must not be venereal
hospitals, but services or parts of general hospitals,
so that patients who are received into them will be
protected from stigma and comment. Pontopidan,
a Danish expert, estimated that for the care of venereal
disease one hospital bed to every 2000 of
population was insufficient, and yet there are cities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
in this country which do not have one bed available
for the purpose to 100,000 people. The hospital
performs a peculiarly valuable function in the care
of syphilis in particular. It provides for temporary
quarantine, and for the education of the patient in
his responsibility to the community when he is discharged.
Three weeks or more under hospital direction
is the best possible start for an active syphilis
that is to be cured. The privacy of a syphilitic can
be protected in a hospital as successfully as in a
specialist's office, and the quality of treatment which
can be given him is distinctly better than he can obtain
while out and around. Hospitals in general
have kept their doors closed to syphilis until recently,
and it is only under the pressure of a growing understanding
of what this means to the public health
that they are awakening to their duty.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Cheap Salvarsan.</span>&mdash;Before a general campaign for
the successful treatment of syphilis can be made a
fact, salvarsan must become, as has already been
pointed out, a public and not a private asset. It
must be available to all who need it at the lowest
possible cost<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>&mdash;practically that of manufacture&mdash;and
must be supplied by the state when necessary.
The granting of patent rights which make possible
the present exploitation for gain of such vital agents
in the protection of the public health is a mistake
which we should lose no time in remedying. While
salvarsan does not mean the cure of syphilis, it does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
mean a large part of its control as an infectious disease.
When it can be given only to the person who
can muster from five to twenty-five dollars for each
dose which he receives, it is evident that its usefulness
is likely to be seriously restricted.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a>
The price of salvarsan before the war was $3.50 per full dose for
the drug alone. It can be profitably marketed at less than $1.00 per
dose. The patent rights have been temporarily suspended during the
war, and their renewal by Congress should not be permitted.</p></div>

<p><span class="caption">Reduction of the Expense of Efficient Treatment.</span>&mdash;Free
treatment for those who cannot afford
to pay is a necessary part of the successful operation
of any scheme for the control of sexual disease. But
for those who can and are willing to pay a moderate
amount for what they receive, there should be pay
clinics which will bridge the gap between the rough
and ready quality and the unpleasant associations
of a free dispensary, and the expensive luxuries of a
specialist's office. This is a field which is almost
virgin in this country, and which deserves public
support. There is no reason why, for a reasonable
fee, the patient with syphilis should not secure all the
benefits of hospital care, the personal attention of
specially trained men, an intelligent supervision of
his case, and the benefit of co&ouml;peration between a
hospital service in charge of experts and the home
doctor who must care for him during a considerable
part of the course of his disease. Provision of this
sort makes treatment both more attractive and more
available to large numbers of people whose pride
keeps them away from the public provision for charity
cases, and whose limited means leave them at the
mercy either of quackery or of well-meaning but
entirely inexperienced physicians.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Value of Expert Services.</span>&mdash;The factor of expert
judgment in the care and recognition of syphilis is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
an important one, and a progressive public policy
will not neglect to provide for it. The state, municipal
or hospital laboratory which professes to do
Wassermann tests should not be in charge of some
poorly paid amateur or of a technician largely concerned
with other matters, or its findings will be
worthless. Every clinic and hospital should also
attach to its staff an expert consultant on syphilis on
whom it can draw for advice in doubtful cases and
for the direction of its methods of work. Every
city health board which undertakes a serious campaign
against syphilis should not be satisfied merely
with doing Wassermanns, but should enlist in behalf
of the public consultation of the same grade which
it expects to employ in the solution of its traction
and lighting problems, and in the management of
its legal affairs. No one would think nowadays of
placing a physician in charge of a great tuberculosis
sanitarium whose knowledge of the chest was confined
to what he had learned in medical school
twenty or more years before&mdash;yet in a parallel situation
one often finds the subject of syphilis handled
with as little attention to the value of expert knowledge.
Expert service is expensive, and if the state
wishes to command the whole energy of progressive
men, it must be prepared to pay reasonably well for
what it gets.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Suppression of Quacks and Drug-store Prescribing.</span>&mdash;The
suppression of quackery is nowhere more
urgent than in the control of syphilis. Every important
legislative scheme that has come into existence
in recent years has recognized this fact. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
devil may well be fought by fire, and reputable
agencies should enter the field of publicity with some
of the vigor of their disreputable opponents. The
brilliant success of this scheme was admirably illustrated
by the results of the recent efforts of the
Brooklyn Hospital Dispensary, which, by replacing
the placards of advertising quacks in public comfort
and toilet rooms, and running a health exhibit on
Coney Island, attracted to a clinic where modern
diagnosis and treatment were to be had an astonishing
number of young people who would have fallen
victims to quacks. The evil influence of the drug
store in perpetuating the hold of syphilis and gonorrhea
upon us is just being understood. The patient
with a beginning chancre, at the advice of a
drug clerk, tries a little calomel powder on the sore,
and it either "dries up" and secondary symptoms of
syphilis appear in due course, or it gets worse or remains
unchanged and the patient finally goes to a
doctor or a dispensary to find that his meddling has
lost him the golden opportunity of aborting the disease.
If secondaries appear, a bottle or two of XYZ
Specific, again at the suggestion of the all-knowing
drug clerk, containing a little mercury and potassium
iodid, disposes of a mild eruption, and a year or
so later a marriage with subsequent mucous recurrences
and the infection of the wife signalizes the
triumph of ignorance and public shortsightedness.
The health commissioner of one of the largest and
most progressive cities in this country stated before
a recent meeting of the American Public Health
Association that he had sent a special investigator<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
to twelve representative drug stores in his city, and
that simply on describing some symptoms, without
even the ceremony of an examination, he had received
from ten of them something to use on a sore
or to take for gonorrhea. It is only justice to say
that occasionally one finds drug stores which will
refer a patient to a doctor or a dispensary. Drastic
legislation to suppress this sort of malpractice is
part of the program of Great Britain, Germany, and
West Australia, and we in this country cannot too
quickly follow in their steps.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Publicity Campaign.</span>&mdash;The educational campaign
against sexual disease has already been discussed in
theory. In close relation to it is the question of the
use of publicity methods for legitimate ends, mentioned
above. It has had a number of interesting
applications in practice. The West Australian law
has taken the stand of prohibiting all advertising,
replacing the method of attracting the patient into
coming for treatment of his own free will by the
method of making treatment compulsory under
heavy penalty. In this country, where compulsory
legislation will be slow of adoption, publicity methods
will have a certain vogue and a proper place.
It has been of great service in the campaign against
tuberculosis and in the movements for "Better
Babies" and the like. It should never be forgotten
that it is a two-edged weapon, however, and that
where a stigma exists, as in the case of sexual disease,
too much advertising of the place of treatment as
distinguished from the need for it will drive away the
very people whose sensitiveness or need for secrecy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
must be considered. On the other hand, the publication
of material relating to sexual diseases in the
public press has not yet reached the height of its
possibilities, and should be pushed.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Utilization of Personal Prophylaxis.</span>&mdash;Passing now
to the debatable elements in a public campaign,
opinion about the value of personal prophylaxis
(Metchnikoff) against syphilis shows interesting
variations in different countries at the present time.
English-speaking countries hesitate over this. On
the other hand, eminent German authorities, such as
Neisser and Blaschko, urged it at the outset of the
present war, and their views have apparently overcome
a vigorous opposition. As a result, the knowledge
of methods of preventing venereal infection are
being spread broadcast over Germany in the hope
of diminishing the inevitable risk that will arise with
the disbanding of armies after peace is concluded,
no matter how stringent the precautions taken to
insure the health of soldiers before their return to
civil life. The results of this experiment will be
watched with the most intense interest by all those
familiar with the situation, and the results will be of
value as a guide for our own policy when we have had
time to develop one. It is interesting that the most
radical departure in the way of legislative provision
for sexual disease, that of West Australia, takes up
the patient at the point where his infection begins
and promptly places him under penalty in the hands
of a physician, but assumes no responsibility for
other than indirect prevention. The most radical
of all present-day legal measures against the disease<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
has therefore not yet reached the radicalism of compulsory
prophylaxis as it exists in armies, or even the
radicalism of compulsory vaccination for smallpox.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Reporting of Syphilis to Health Officers.</span>&mdash;The
question of reporting syphilis to health officers as a
contagious disease is a good one to raise in a meeting
when a stormy session is desired. Upon this question
wide differences of opinion exist all over the
world. The right of a sick person to privacy, always
deserving of consideration, becomes acute when it
touches not only his physical but his social, economic,
and moral welfare. It becomes a matter of importance
to the state also when the prospect that his
secret will not be kept leads him to conceal his disease
and to avoid good public aid in favor of bad
private care. It is a question whether the amount
gained by collecting a few statistics as to the actual
presence of the disease will be offset by the harm
done in driving to cover persons who will not be
reported. Modified forms of reporting sexual diseases,
without name or address, for example, can
be employed without betraying a patient's identity,
thus doing away with some of the objections, and
they have been in force in such cities as New York
for some time. Vermont has recently adopted a
compulsory reporting system, with the almost ludicrous
result that by the figures her population shows
0.5 per cent syphilis, when the truth probably stands
nearer 10 per cent. Much of the difficulty with reporting
systems goes back to the lack of an educated
public or professional sentiment behind them. For
this reason they may be fairly placed in the category<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
of premature legislative experiments, and should be
postponed until a more favorable time. That this
view has the sanction of students of such problems
is borne out by the recent comment of Hugh Cabot
on this issue, and by the decision of the British Royal
Commission which, after careful deliberation, decided
not to recommend to the Government at the present
time any form of reporting for sexual disease. The
West Australian law recognizes the wisdom of providing
the patient having sexual disease with every
safeguard for his secret provided he conforms to the
requirement of the law in the continuance of his
treatment. German sentiment is strongly against
reporting, and no provision is made for it in the civil
population. On the other hand, the very complete
programs of the Scandinavian countries provide for
reporting cases without names. It is, therefore, apparent,
in view of this conflict of opinion, that we can
afford to watch the experience of our neighbors a
little longer before committing ourselves to the risk
of arousing antagonism over a detail whose importance
in the scheme of attack on syphilis is at best
secondary to the fundamental principles of efficient
treatment and diagnosis. There is no apparent
reason why we should not be satisfied, for the present,
at least, with drawing to our aid everything which
can give us the confidence and the willing co&ouml;peration
of those we want to reach. Physicians who work
with large numbers of these patients realize that
privacy is one of the details which has an attraction
that cannot be ignored.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Compulsory Treatment.</span>&mdash;Compulsory provisions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
in the law form the third debatable feature of a
modern program against syphilis. The Scandinavian
countries have adopted it, and in them a
patient who does not take treatment can be made to
do so. If he is in a contagious condition, he can be
committed to a hospital for treatment. If he infects
another, knowing himself to have a venereal
disease, he is subject, not to fine, but to a long term
of imprisonment. The West Australian law is
even more efficient than the Scandinavian in the
vigor with which it supplies teeth for the bite. The
penalties for violations of its provisions are so heavy
as to most effectually discourage would-be irresponsibles.
At the other end of the scale we find
Great Britain relying thus far solely upon the provision
of adequate treatment, and trusting to the
enlightenment of patients and the education of
public sentiment to induce them to continue treatment
until cured. Italy has, in the same way, left
the matter to the judgment of the patient. The
Medical Association of Munich, Germany, in a recent
study has subscribed to compulsory treatment
along the same lines as the West Australia act, although
thus far enforcement has been confined to
military districts. The program for disbanding of
the German army after the war, however, includes,
under Blaschko's proposals, compulsion and surveillance
carried to the finest details. A conservative
summary of the situation seems to justify the belief
that measures of compulsion will ultimately form an
essential part of a fully developed legal code for the
control of syphilis. The reasons for this belief have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
been extensively reviewed in the discussion of the
nature of the disease itself (pages 104-105). On the
whole, however, the method of Great Britain in
looking first to the provision for adequate diagnosis
and treatment, and then to the question as to who
will not avail himself of it, is a logical mode of attacking
the question, and as it develops public sentiment
in its favor, will also pave the way for a sentiment
which will stand back of compulsion if need
be, and save it from being a dead letter.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Backwardness of the United States in the Movement.</span>&mdash;It
will be apparent, from the foregoing review
of the world movement against syphilis, and
the essentials of a public policy toward the disease,
that the majority of our efforts in this direction have
been decidedly indirect. We have no national program
of which we as a people are conscious. It is
all we can do to arouse a sentiment to the effect that
something ought to be done. In these critical times
we must mobilize for action in this direction with as
much speed at least as we show in developing an
army and navy, slow though we are in that. To
limit our efforts to the passing of freak state legislation
regulating the price of a Wassermann to determine
the fitness of a person for marriage, when both
Wassermann test itself, and Wassermann test as
evidence of fitness for marriage, are likely, under the
conditions, to be absolutely worthless, is to play
penny eugenics. The move to take the gag from
the mouth of the physician when an irresponsible
with a venereal disease aims to spread his infection
by marriage is at least intelligent, preventive, even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
if indirect, legislation, because it acts before and not
after the event. Although at the present time we
cannot boast a single example of a complete program
of direct legislation, the example of Michigan, which
is providing free hospital treatment for adults and
children with syphilis, should be watched as the first
radical step in the right direction. If war and our
mobilization for defense leave us with every hospital
and dispensary and public health resource and all
the expert judgment we have available within our
borders enlisted finally in a great campaign against
gonorrhea and syphilis, it will have accomplished a
miracle, though it will have done no more than war
has done for Europe. If it leaves us even with our
more progressive states committed to an expanding
program of universal efficient and accessible diagnosis
and treatment, it will have conferred a blessing.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Relation of War to the Spread of Venereal Disease.</span>&mdash;The
frequent reference to the relation of war to
the problems of sexual disease seems to justify a
concluding paragraph on this aspect of the matter.
Much of the impetus which has carried European
nations so far along the road toward an organized
attack on syphilis and gonorrhea, as has been said, is
undoubtedly due to the realization that war in the
past has been the ally of these diseases, and that a
campaign against them is as essential to national
self-defense as the organization of a vast army.
Conflicting reports are coming from various sources
as to the prevalence of syphilis and gonorrhea among
European troops, although hopeful indications seem
to be that troops in the field may have even a lower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
rate of disability than in peace times (British figures).
The most serious risks are encountered in troops
withdrawn from the front or sent home on leave,
often demoralized by the strain of the trenches.
The steady rise in the amount of syphilis in a civil
population during war is evidenced, for example, by
the figures of Gaucher's clinic in Paris, in which, just
before the war, 10 per cent of patients were syphilitic;
after the first sixteen months of the war 16.6 per cent
were syphilitic, and in the last eight months, up to
December, 1916, 25 per cent had the disease. There
can be no doubt that a campaign of publicity can
do much to control the wholesale spread of infection
under war conditions, and we should bend our efforts
to it, and to the more substantial work of providing
for treatment and the prevention of infectiousness,
with as much energy as we devote to the other tasks
which preparedness has forced upon us. The rigorous
provisions proposed for continental armies should
be carefully studied, and in no cases in which either
syphilis or gonorrhea is active should leave or discharge
be granted until the infectious period is over.
Compelling infected men to remain in the army under
military discipline until cured might have a deterrent
effect upon promiscuous exposure. In addition we
should create as rapidly as possible a mechanism for
keeping inactive cases under surveillance after discharge
until there can no longer be the slightest
doubt as to their fitness to re&euml;nter civil life. Observers
of European conditions in the population at
large are emphatic in saying that home conditions
must have as much attention as the army, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
suppression of open prostitution, a watchful eye on
the conditions under which women are employed
or left unemployed, and the control of contributory
factors, such as the liquor traffic, must be rigorously
carried out. Nation-wide prohibition will do much
to control venereal disease.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It is interesting and
significant that little reliance is being placed on the
obsolete idea that prostitution can be made a legitimate
and safe part of army life solely by personal
prophylactic methods, or by any system of inspection
of the women concerned. It is a hopeful sign that
this conception is at last meeting with the discredit
which has long been due it.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a>
Through the effect on prostitution. A well-known and very intelligent
prostitute, with whom this question was recently discussed, rated
the liquor traffic first among the influences tending to promote prostitution.</p></div>

<p>The question has occurred to those interested in
compulsory military service as a measure of national
defense as to whether the mobilization of troops for
training will favor the spread of sexual disease. Unfortunately,
there are no satisfactory figures for
the civil population showing how many persons per
thousand per year acquire syphilis or gonorrhea, to
be compared with the known figures for the onset
of such infections in the army. Arguing from general
considerations, however, there seems to be no
reason to suppose that the army will show a higher
proportion of infections than civilians. In fact,
there is every ground for believing that the percentage
will be lower, since the army is protected by a
fairly efficient and enforceable system of prophylaxis
which is taught to the men, and they live, moreover,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
under a general medical discipline which reduces the
risk of infection from other than genital sources to
the lowest possible terms. In opposition to the
conception that the sexual ideals of the army are
low, it may be urged that they are no lower than
those of corresponding grades in civil life, and that
hard work and rigid discipline have a much better
effect in stiffening moral backbone than the laxities
of present-day social life. In the last analysis, the
making of the moral tone of the army is in our own
hands, and by putting into it good blood and high
ideals, we can do as much to raise from it a clean
manhood as by submitting that same manhood to
the temptations and inducements to sexual laxity that
it meets on every street corner.</p>

<p>This chapter closes the discussion of syphilis as a
problem for the every-day man and woman. It
represents essentially the cross-section of a moving
stream. Today's truth may be tomorrow's error in
any field of human activity, and medicine is no exception
to this law of change. It is impossible to
speak gospel about many things connected with
syphilis, or to offer more than current opinion, based
on the keenest investigation of the facts which modern
methods make possible. None the less, the
great landmarks in our progress stand out with fair
prospect of permanent place. The germ, the recognition
of the disease by blood test and dark field
microscope, the treatment and prevention seem built
on a firm foundation. As they stand, without regard
to further advances, they offer a brilliant future
to a campaign for control To that campaign, each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
and every one of us can address himself with the
prospect of adding his mite of energy to a tremendous
movement for human betterment. For every man
or woman to whom the word syphilis can be made to
mean, not a secret, private, shameful disease, but a
great open problem in public health, a recruit has
been called to the colors. There are no signs more
hopeful of the highest destiny for humanity than
those of today which mark the transition of disease
from a personal to a social problem. Such a transition
foreshadows the passing of syphilis. In that
transition, each one of us has his part. Toward that
consummation, a goal only to be won by united and
stubborn assault, each one of us can contribute the
comprehension, the sympathetic support, the indomitable
determination, which make victory.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
